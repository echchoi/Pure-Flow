```
We have all heard that we can learn from our elders. By taking this advice and looking at
geographic regions on earth where the density of centenarians is higher than normal, we have
learned from the elders living there the secret of healthy longevity. Amazingly there is magic in
their drinking water and in some of the food they eat! The science behind this magic and how we
can use it to achieve our own individual and cultural healthy longevity is the subject of this book.
We need this magic more now than ever before as we are living in the Aluminum Age in which
neurotoxin aluminum is being increasingly put in our food, drinking water, kitchen ware,
pharmaceuticals, vaccines, colored candy, cosmetics, and even the air we inhale. If you are
interested in finding out what is behind the curtain of this magic, join me in the exciting search
for the secret of healthy longevity in the aluminum age.

## About the Title

This book is the fourth edition of my popular 2018 book by a similar title. In addition to a new
title and cover, there is updated anecdotal information on silica water’s efficacy for treating
Alzheimer’s disease in Chapter 5, new analytical data on high silica waters in Appendix I and
IV, and more data on TRS and Epson salt baths in Chapter 7.

The “aluminum age” was first mentioned in an 1893 editorial by the British weekly the Spectator
that was inspired by Alfred Gilbert’s aluminum statue of Eros^452. This was the first London
statue to be cast in aluminum. The statue was unveiled in 1893 and is currently located on the
southeastern side of Piccadilly Circus. Gilbert said the statue represented “the blindfolded Love
sending forth indiscriminately, yet with purpose, his missile of kindness, always with the
swiftness of the bird has from its wings”. The editor for the Spectator was more enamored with
aluminum and hailed aluminum as “beautiful to the eye, whiter than silver, and indestructible by
contact with air, _... strong, elastic, and so light that the imagination almost refuses to conceive it_
as a metal.” The editor concluded just as “the world has seen its age of stone, its age of bronze,
and its age of iron, so it may before long have embarked on a new and even more prosperous era

_-_ the age of aluminium.”^452

Love for aluminum at first sight can be deceiving.

## About the Author

My interest in silica water was inspired by a desire to help my mother slow the progression of
her Alzheimer’s disease. My mother was 86 when she lost her short-term memory and was
diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The facts that she had MCI and could no
longer perform daily tasks such as meal preparation, sewing, and balancing the checkbook, were
indications she had Alzheimer’s disease. In order to save my mother from the terrible death of
end-stage Alzheimer’s disease (AD), I devoted myself to studying scientific literature looking for
causal factors of AD. My belief was that only by finding a causal factor could I help my mother
stop the progression of AD.

After 3 years of reading, I concluded that aluminum is a causal factor of AD and that my mother
was being exposed to the following daily sources of aluminum:

- Drinking Water (50mcg/L aluminum and no silica)
- Drip Style Coffee Maker - with aluminum heating element (260mcg/L of aluminum)
- Baking Powder (50mg aluminum per teaspoon)
- Homemade Tomato Juice - made in an aluminum kettle (>1,000mcg/L of aluminum)

I also read Dr. Christopher Exley’s work on daily silica water treatments improving cognition in
some Alzheimer’s patients by facilitating aluminum excretion and hoped this might work for my
mother. Luckily my mother and father still had the ability to adapt to change. In other words,
they had resiliency and were willing to make lifestyle changes to avoid sources of aluminum.
Most importantly they were willing to switch over to drinking silica water (e.g., Fiji water)
instead of tap water.

In 2014, my 87-year-old mother, who at the time was diagnosed with MCI, began daily drinking
an OSA rich water (i.e., Fiji Water) in an effort to improve her loss of short-term memory. My
mother is an ApoE E 4 carrier. After two years of daily drinking the OSA rich water there was
both a clearly noticeable and clinically evaluated improvement in my mother’s short-term


memory at age 89. I was very thankful! Her improved memory allowed my mother to continue to
live in her home with only my father’s help. Mother drank Fiji water every day in her coffee and
tea for 5 years from age 87 to 92. After my father died in early 2019 at age 95, my mother no
longer regularly drank Fiji water but continued to live alone in her house to age 94½. Sadly since
2019 her memory resumed its decline.

My research on Alzheimer’s disease and ways to prevent it are summarized in my book “Prevent
Alzheimer’s, Autism, and Stroke with 7 Supplements, 7 Lifestyle Choices, and a Dissolved
Mineral”^1. The dissolved mineral is a water-soluble silica derivative called orthosilicic acid
(OSA). The reversal of Alzheimer’s symptoms in my mother motivated me to write this book on
the health and longevity benefits of silica water.

I was fortunate as a freshman at Harvard to have Dr. Lewis L. Engle Professor of Biological
Chemistry at Harvard Medical School as my tutor. During our first meeting Dr. Engle suggested
I read a book written almost 40 years earlier by Lawrence J. Henderson Assistant Professor of
Biological Chemistry at Harvard University entitled “The Fitness of The Environment”. This
book describes how the earth’s chemical environment made life on earth sustainable. The
information in Henderson’s book shaped my career path.

Even before graduating from Harvard with a Ph.D. I cofounded a company to detect and quantify
toxic chemicals in food. The company’s commercial chemical analysis laboratory performed
analytical procedures for a wide variety of toxic environmental chemicals. Most of these toxic
chemicals are man-made and eroding the fitness of our environment for sustaining life on earth.

Because of my recent research into my mother’s Alzheimer’s disease, I have now added
aluminum to the list of toxic chemicals that are increasing in our diet and accumulating in our
brains due to man’s influence. Aluminum is a neurotoxin and chronic accumulation of aluminum
has been linked to a variety of diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease. Aluminum has become
more bioavailable since the dawn of the Aluminum Age in the 18 8 0’s when a process to purify
aluminum from bauxite was developed. Like the Stone, Bronze, and Iron Ages that preceded it,
the Aluminum Age has brought great changes, both good and bad, to human civilization.


In addition to the factors making life sustainable on earth, as discussed by Henderson in his
book, we can now add silicon, the second most abundant element in the earth’s crust. In the
earth’s crust silicon is bonded to oxygen, the most abundant element in the earth’s crust,
resulting in silica and its fully hydrated form OSA that facilitates the detoxification of aluminum,
the third most abundant element in the earth’s crust.

I have written three other books:

- “Prevent Alzheimer’s, Autism, and Stroke”
- “Increased IQ, Cognition and COVID-19 Cure Rate with Essential Nutrients”
- “Finding a Cause and Potential Cures for Alzheimer’s Disease”

There are also five videos on You Tube:

- “Brain Fitness in the Aluminum Age – Preventing Alzheimer’s”
- “Brain Fitness in the Aluminum Age - Eliminating Aluminum”
- “Brain Fitness in the Aluminum Age – Coffer Makers”
- “Silica Water – How to Make it at Home”
- “Silica Water for Reversing Alzheimer’s

Secret of Healthy Longevity in the Aluminum Age”.


## Introduction

This book is about silica water containing an overlooked miracle molecule that protects our life
and maintains our health. It is in our bodies even before birth but during our life it ebbs and
flows and needs supplementation to be steadily maintained. This superstar of a molecule is
called orthosilicic acid (OSA). For most organisms, including humans, it is essential for life^72. In
fact, it is said that OSA is the most important molecule for life on earth. OSA is a miracle
molecule because it protects plants, animals, and even humans from toxic forms of aluminum.

We are fortunate on earth to have oxygen and silicon as the two most abundant elements in the
earth’s crust. Over millions of years silicon has become oxidized by oxygen to a variety of
silicon oxides that have in turn formed into a variety of silicon containing minerals as described
in Chapter 1. One of these silicon oxides is OSA, a water-soluble oxide of silicon. As life
evolved on earth so did unique ways to use OSA for protection from aluminum, the third most
common element in the earth’s crust. The mechanisms by which plants and animals, including
humans, use OSA as protection from aluminum toxicity are described in Chapter 2.

Aluminum has become more bioavailable since the dawn of the Aluminum Age in the 18 8 0’s
when a process to purify aluminum from bauxite was developed. This has opened a Pandora’s
Box of aluminum compounds and products that have exponentially increased over the last 120
years and are now in our drinking water, food, kitchen-ware, drugs, vaccines, and even the air we
inhale. These products, listed in Appendix II and III, increase both our aluminum ingestion and
aluminum accumulation in our bodies. It is chronic aluminum accumulation that is involved in
the etiology of a variety of diseases that shorten our lives including: Alzheimer’s disease,
atherosclerosis (i.e., heart disease), autism, cancer, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease,
seizures, and osteoporosis as will be discussed in Chapter 5 of this book.

Writing this book has been a journey, as along the way I have met people who have changed the
course of my thinking and writing. For instance, at my local library’s author’s day I met the
author, Martha R.A. Fields, who is originally from Okinawa, Japan. Martha told me that on
Okinawa Island there is a high density of centenarians. In addition, demographers have studied
Okinawans and found lower than normal rates of Alzheimer’s, atherosclerosis, and cancer. They


have also found that Okinawans have a higher-than-normal probability of both living to 90+ and
being in good health. These facts changed my thinking as Okinawans provide a longitudinal
study of what factors are important for avoiding terminal diseases and living a long healthy life.

Drug companies are currently spending millions of dollars on multi-year studies looking for
preventatives and cures for Alzheimer’s, heart disease, and cancer. What if there are already
published studies on populations of 90 to 100-year-olds whose healthy longevity is due to
abnormally low rates of Alzheimer’s, heart disease, and cancer? If these studies exist, they would
be equivalent to having century long longitudinal studies just waiting for people to find what
they have in common that prevented and possibly cured these diseases.

Amazingly, in addition to Okinawa there are five other small geographic regions on earth that
have been identified as having populations with higher survival rates of reaching 90+ years of
age than surrounding areas^2. These geographic regions are called longevity regions in this book
in order to not infringe U.S. trademarks. For instance, the word “blue” is part of a commonly
used U.S. trademark that describes some of these longevity regions. This is because
demographers had circled some of these regions on maps as they were discovered with blue
ink^120. The environment and lifestyle of these longevity regions can potentially teach valuable
lessons that may allow us to achieve healthy longevity by preventing and possibly healing
diseases that can shorten our lives, such as Alzheimer’s disease, heart disease, cancer, seizures,
multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson’s disease.

Could it be that all longevity regions have in common substrata rich in silicate minerals? If so,
underground fresh water in contact with substrata could bubble to the surface as OSA rich
drinking water. Chapter 3 of this book discloses the secret of health longevity - how and why
drinking silica rich water results in healthy longevity.

By just having silica water (e.g., Fiji water) delivered to their door and eliminating common
sources of aluminum from their diet, my parents made their home in Iowa a micro-longevity
region. Due to their resiliency adapting to changing lifestyles, my mother regained her short-
term memory and temporarily stopped the progression of her Alzheimer’s disease. My father
and mother exemplify what others could do to improve their individual healthy longevity.


## Chapter 1 – Silica Water

This book is about the type of silica called orthosilicic acid (OSA, a.k.a. reactive silica) as
diagrammed in Figure 1. When OSA is dissolved in water the mixture is called silica water.

OSA is soluble in water at low concentrations (e.g., at or below 2 millimolar = mM or 200 parts
per million = ppm)^17. OSA polymerizes above pH 8 at concentrations higher than 2 00ppm. This
polymerization is catalyzed by magnesium and calcium^18 ,1^9. OSA polymerization is also
catalyzed at pH 7 by cyanobacteria in contact with ferrihydrite, a commonly found mineral in
fresh water and marine environments of the world^20.

Silica water is safe to ingest. It is not an evolutionary accident that dissolved silica is found in
mother’s breastmilk^21. Silica water is generally regarded as safe (GRAS) by the U.S. FDA in
drinking water at or below 160ppm of OSA (Si(OH) 4 ) or 100ppm of dissolved silica (SiO 2 )^22.
OSA is found at low concentrations in most tap water in the U.S.A. OSA is natural occurring and
is also added to drinking water by community water companies to control corrosion^23.

There are commercially available natural waters rich in OSA. In the following list the waters
tested for OSA concentration are indicated with a ”*” (see Appendix I for more silica waters):

- Starkey Spring Water from Idaho is available from Whole Foods ( 93 ppm OSA*)
- Fiji water from Fiji is available in the U.S.A. (1 46 ppm OSA*)
- Langkawi Pure from Malaysia is available in Asia and U.S.A. (133ppm OSA*)
- Volvic water from France is available in the U.S.A. and Europe (51 ppm OSA*)
- Gerolsteiner from Germany is available in Europe (64ppm OSA*)
- Acilis water from Malaysia is available in Europe ( 88 ppm OSA)


As we will see in this book, OSA in drinking water is essential for life and good health leading to
greater longevity. OSA supplementation in one’s diet is recommended to prevent diseases caused
by aluminum. Also, a procedure is described in Chapter 6 for making inexpensive and more
sustainable supplementary synthetic OSA from powdered hydrous sodium silicate and sodium
bisulfate. This synthetic OSA rich water is called “Silicade” and it contains 146 ppm of OSA,
identical to Fiji water.

### PPM a Unit of Measure of OSA in Silica Water

The weight in milligrams of chemical dissolved in a million milligrams of water is called parts
per million or ppm. The ppm unit of measure expresses the concentration of the chemical
dissolved in water. The weight per atom of a chemical is called molecular weight (MW). There
can be oxygen and hydrogen atoms bonded to elemental silicon forming derivatives of increased
MW. The concentration when expressed as “ppm of silicon” must be multiplied by 3.4 to be
expressed as “ppm of OSA” because of the additional MW of four OH’s. Here are some
common conversion factors based upon molecular weight differences:

- Si (MW 28) is called “elemental silicon” that is multiplied by 3.4 to get ppm of OSA
- SiO 2 (MW 60) is called “silica” that is multiplied by 1.6 to get ppm of OSA
- Si(OH) 4 (MW 96) is called orthosilicic acid, OSA, or reactive silica

In this book dissolved orthosilicic acid in water is expressed as ppm OSA, unless otherwise
specified. Note that one ppm is equivalent to one milligram per liter (a.k.a. 1mg/L)

### PPB a Unit of Measure of Aluminum in Water

The weight in milligrams of chemical dissolved in a billion milligrams of water is called parts
per billion or ppb. The ppb unit of measure expresses the concentration of the chemical dissolved
in water. This is a common unit of measure for aluminum in water. Note that one ppb is
equivalent to one microgram per liter (a.k.a. 1mcg/L).


### Other Forms of Silicon

#### Elementary Silicon

Silicon is a chemical element with the symbol Si and it is the second most abundant element in
the earth’s crust. It is used as a semiconductor for components in electronic products. Silicon
has a very high affinity for oxygen that is the most abundant element in the earth’s crust. Silicon
has been slowly oxidized to silica over millions of years in the earth’s oxygen rich environment.
Most of the earth’s crust is composed of silicon, primarily as silica and silicate containing
minerals.

#### Silicon Dioxide

Silicon dioxide is the anhydride of OSA and is the simplest oxide of silicon with the chemical
structure SiO 2. Silicon dioxide is found in nature in many physical forms including:

- Crystalline such as quartz
- Amorphous such as the major component of sand
- Shells of diatoms and radiolariens such as diatomaceous earth
- Colloidal such as commercial silica supplements

These forms of silica have low water solubility and dissolve as OSA very slowly in water on a
time-scale of years. Therefore, when they are placed in water, they provide only traces of
bioavailable OSA^1. Also, there are manmade nanometer sized particles (nanoparticles) of silicon
dioxide called aerogels and silica gels, such as found in Saguna Colloidal Silicogel. Silicon
dioxide in most of these physical forms is considered insoluble, as it takes years to dissolve in
water as OSA.

Inhaling fine particles of insoluble silicon dioxide causes irritation and can lead to silicosis,
bronchitis, lung cancer, and systemic autoimmune diseases, such as lupus and rheumatoid
arthritis^24.


#### Silica Nanoparticles

Intravenously administered silica nanoparticles cause liver damage in mice^25. Injection of silica
nanoparticles into the body cavity of mice induces an inflammatory response^26. Some
nanoparticles of silicon dioxide have been found to be cytotoxic when tested in vitro (i.e., in
glass) on three different types of human cells^27.

Orally ingested silica nanoparticles (20nm to 100nm) were determined in a 90-day study of rats
to have a no adverse effects limit (NOEAL) of 2,000mg per kilogram per day^28. No animals
were treated over this limit and animals treated at this limit had no treatment-related clinical
changes and no histopathological findings were observed in any of the treated animals^28. Even
though inhalation of nanoparticles and injection of nanoparticles into the blood and body cavity
should be avoided, the high NOEAL indicates oral ingestion of tenths of a gram of silica
nanoparticles a day is safe for rats.

The 2014 finding that oral ingestion of silica nanoparticles is safe for rats is not surprising. Rats
and humans eat plants and food derived from plants. Almost all plants make silica nanoparticles,
called phytoliths, in an effort to sequester OSA for protection from aluminum toxicity, as
discussed later in this chapter. Therefore, rats and humans have evolved to tolerate oral ingestion
of phytoliths and even benefit from their consumption. Phytoliths bind tightly with aluminum
ions in the gut. This prevents some aluminum from being absorbed by the gut and facilitates the
excretion of aluminum as discussed in more detail in Chapter 2.

#### Silicate Oligomers................................................................................................................................

Some natural and manmade oligomers (i.e., polymers) of sodium silicate, can be converted to
OSA in water at room temperature in a matter of hours at pH 4.7 to a matter of days at pH
7.2^2 9,30. In addition, supersaturated OSA in water (e.g., 960ppm) above pH 8 can be converted
back to oligomeric colloids of sodium silicate in a matter of hours^29. These oligomeric colloids
are in a pH dependent equilibrium with OSA above OSA’s saturation level (i.e., greater than
200ppm) in water. Therefore, these manmade oligomeric colloids of sodium silicate could
provide a healthy oral source of less than 200ppm of OSA, only when allowed enough time to
dissolve in a sufficient volume of weakly acidic water before oral ingestion.


Natural or manmade oligomers of sodium silicate should not be taken orally without drinking a
volume of water sufficient to dissolve and dilute them to below the saturation level of OSA in
water (i.e., 200ppm). When this lack of sufficient water occurs, there may be a risk that OSA
will crystallize out of a supersaturated OSA solution in the kidneys forming painful silica stones.
However, silica kidney stones have never been reported after ingesting oligomers of sodium
silicate.

#### Magnesium Trisilicate

Silica kidney stones do rarely occur in those who ingest large amounts of magnesium trisilicate
without drinking a sufficient volume of water^31. Magnesium trisilicate is a compound of silicon
dioxide (not less than 45%) and magnesium oxide (not less than 20%) the rest being water.
Magnesium trisilicate is used in some antacids as it reacts to neutralize stomach acid. It is also
used by fast food chains, such as KFC, to absorb fatty acids and remove impurities that form in
the edible oils during the frying process.

Unlike sodium silicate that is soluble in water (22.2gr./100cc), magnesium trisilicate is
practically insoluble in water. Ingesting undissolved silicates is a health risk because without
adequate water intake the silicates can become supersaturated in the kidney lumen and
polymerize or crystallize forming stones (a.k.a. silica uroliths) containing primarily silica (a.k.a.
silica urolithiasis). In general silicon containing kidney stones are rare and only found in those
who consume large amounts of magnesium trisilicate^31.

#### Silicones

Silicones (a.k.a. polysiloxanes) are manmade polymers of siloxane ( [Si-O]n ) usually with
carbon and/or hydrogen atoms bonded to the silicon atom. These polymers are very stable and
used for grease, rubber, resin, and lubricants. Silicones are also used for cooking utensils and
coatings on cookware. These applications of silicones are considered safe.

Gels of silicones are used for breast implants. If the implant ruptures, silicone leaking from the
implant can cause inflammatory nodules in the breast and armpit areas and enlarged lymph
glands in the armpit areas of the body^32.


## Chapter 2 – Silica Water for Protection from Aluminum

### Silica Water is Essential for Diatoms and Radiolarians

The old adage that good things come in small packages is definitely true for some microscopic
life forms that use polymerized silicon dioxide for their elaborate skeletons. Examples of these
primitive life forms are diatoms and radiolarians. Their skeletons are almost pure silica and
appear to be elaborate, delicate, and breathtakingly beautiful baskets that protect these simple
organisms as shown in Figure 2.

Diatoms and radiolarians are unicellular microalgae that are plentiful in the oceans of the world
accounting for 40% of global oceanic biological productivity^33. This level of productivity
requires a stable concentration of OSA in ocean water. When these organisms die, the silica in
their skeletons very slowly dissolves helping to keep the oceanic concentration of OSA constant
at 2ppm near the surface. Other sources of silica are slowly dissolving chert, clay, silt, and sand
as terrestrial detritus carried by rivers into the oceans.


Radiolarians evolved approximately 542 million years ago in the Paleozoic Era. Diatoms are the
new kids on the block having tremendous evolutionary success beginning in the late Mesozoic
Era and exponentially increasing in the Eocene Epoch (a.k.a. first half of the Cenozoic Era)
around 56 to 34 million years ago. Diatoms currently account for 90 percent of the suspended
silica in the oceans. Vast amounts of undissolved diatoms and radiolarians have settled to the
bottom of the world’s oceans. Over millions of years some of these ocean sediments have
become uplifted and made a part of regional subsurface geology. Some limestone and chert
containing formations have high amounts of silica due to fossilized skeletons of diatoms and
radiolarians. Regions of the world with these formations are more likely to have high levels of
OSA in drinking and irrigation water. Examples include:

- Naha Limestone that underlies Okinawa Island14,
- Sedimentary Late Mesozoic to Eocene Limestone that underlies Villagrande, Sardinia10,
- Chert in Punta Conchal Formation that underlies Nicoya, Costa Rica.^35

The high levels of OSA in the drinking and irrigation water of the Okinawan, Sardinian, and
Nicoyan longevity regions is likely due to these subsurface diatomaceous and radiolarian
deposits.

### How Silica Water Provides Protection from Aluminum

Aluminum in any one of a number of chemical forms is toxic to both plants and animals43,59. In
acidic water, below pH 4.5, aluminum is ionic having three positive charges. Nearer neutrality,
in water above pH 5.5, ionic aluminum is hydroxylated with OH- ions from water molecules to
make monomeric and dimeric aluminum hydroxide^36. In this case monomers are single
molecules of aluminum hydroxide and dimers are two molecules of aluminum hydroxide
condensed together as shown in Figure 337. Both the hydroxylations and the condensation are
reversible in acidic water below pH 4.5^38.

Dissolved silica (i.e., OSA) detoxifies aluminum. Silicon and aluminum have some similarities
as they are next to each other on the periodic table of elements and they both have an affinity for
oxygen. OSA, and the dimer of aluminum hydroxide are a match made in heaven. Depending


on the ratio of dissolved silica to aluminum in water, one or two molecules of OSA condense
above pH 5 .5 with a dimer of aluminum hydroxide to form one of the two stable
hydroxyaluminosilicate (HAS) complexes HASA and HASB diagramed in Figure 337.

- HASA is a stable 1 to 1 complex of OSA and aluminum hydroxide dimer that forms when
    there is less than a 1 to 1 ratio of OSA to aluminum in water^39 ,4^0.
- HASB is a stable 2 to 1 complex of OSA and aluminum hydroxide dimer that forms when
    there is at least a 1 to 1 ratio of OSA to aluminum in water^3 9,^40.

Both of these complexes are non-toxic. Below pH 4.5 these relatively insoluble crystalline
complexes are slowly hydrolyzed back into OSA and toxic ionic aluminum^40.

Plants and animals have evolved to use OSA for protection from aluminum. Plants store
sequestered aluminum as HASB in both apoplasts and biosilifications, such as phytoliths. While
animals both store sequestered aluminum as HASA in lysosomes and excrete aluminum as dilute
HASB back into the environment in urine and perspiration. These schemes make use of the
chemistry of OSA and aluminum to provide protection from toxic aluminum in the environment.
These schemes have worked for millions of years but with the advent of the aluminum age some
have proven to be insufficient to handle the recently introduced higher levels of aluminum.


### Silica Water Protects Plants

In the hilly woods near where I live there is a flat tennis court sized area that for as long as
anyone can remember has been devoid of all but sparse grass. Trees and a natural berm on one
side of this area shield it from view by anyone on the nearest street. A lack of plants over a few
inches high indicates a lack of root growth in this area. Why is this small area devoid of plants
taller than a few inches?

Finding a clue involves only digging a hole a few inches deep to reveal a thin layer of clay. The
local oral history of this unique place involves going back to the 1930’s when the preacher of the
local First Congregational Church told his flock to not perform recreational sports on Sundays in
favor of prayer and bible reading. In order to avoid the preacher’s wrath some sports-minded
members of his flock surreptitiously built a natural clay tennis court out of his watchful eye. It
must have been popular because rumor has it that even the preacher’s wife could be found on
some Sunday afternoons at the tennis court in the woods.

Some theorize that clay blocking water from reaching roots is the reason for no tall plants. But
actually, the reason is soil chemistry. Natural clay used for the tennis court in the woods consists
of an aluminum containing mineral called kaolinite. Aluminum is released from kaolinite as
aluminum ions when acid rain below pH 4.5 falls on the natural clay41,42. Aluminum ions are
phytotoxic to root growth as shown in Figure 443. In fact, aluminum phytotoxicity in acid soils is
one of the biggest limitations to worldwide crop production^44.


Although silicon is not considered essential for plants, plants have evolved incredible ways to
use OSA and silica for protection from phytotoxic aluminum. Seven of the ten most important
crops in the world are silicon accumulators with above 1% of these plants by dry weight being
silicon^44. It is generally agreed that plants accumulate silica by absorbing OSA either actively or
passively from the soil or airborne aerosols. OSA has been found to protect the roots of the
following plants from aluminum phytotoxicity: maize (a.k.a. corn)^45 , barley^46 , soybean^47 , and
sorghum^48.

In the case of maize (Zea mays) the mechanism by which aluminum inhibits root growth has
been studied^49. Aluminum slowly diffuses through the outer epidermal layers of roots cells
accumulating in the growing root tip. This causes the plant to respond by producing a plant
polysaccharide called callose in the epidermis of the root tip. Callose catalyzes the
polymerization of sub-saturated OSA forming insoluble silica in the epidermal cells of the root
tip49,5^0. This silica becomes a rigid barrier to aluminum diffusion as the silica binds tightly to
aluminum^30. It is theorized that this rigidification of the epidermal layers of the root tip in
response to aluminum results in inhibition of root growth^49.


In addition, cells in the roots of maize actively accumulate OSA in their apoplast^45. The apoplast
is the space inside the cell wall but outside the root cell’s plasma membrane where chemicals can
diffuse freely though a continuum of adjacent cell walls. Nutrients and toxins use the apoplastic
route in order to gain entry through the plasma membrane into a root cell. OSA sequestered in
the apoplast complexes with phytotoxic aluminum forming non-phytotoxic HAS
(hydroxyaluminosilicates) preventing aluminum from entering root cells and protecting the
plant^45.

Trees also absorb OSA and an example is Norway Spruce (Picea abies). This absorbed OSA
was found to ameliorate the phytotoxic effects of aluminum on Norway Spruce seedlings grown
hydroponically above pH 4.5^51. How is this protection possible as this is below pH 5.5 needed
for HAS formation? The explanation is OSA detoxifies aluminum to form HAS only inside root
cells of the Norway Spruce seedlings where the pH is actively increased from 4.5 outside to 5.5
inside the root cells. This pH increase is performed by root cells actively absorbing and
accumulating OSA from the hydroponic solution^52.

Another way plants detoxify aluminum is sequestration in solid silica phytoliths (a.k.a. biogenic
opal) made of polymerized OSA. The word phytoliths is Greek for plant stones. Phytoliths are
microscopic structures made of silica by the plant and shown in Figure 5. After plants die, the
phytoliths become fossils that can last for millions of years. Because carbon becomes occluded
in some phytoliths they can be radiocarbon-dated. The phytoliths in Figure 5 are 9,000 years old
and were made by rice plants in China at the beginning of the Holocene Period^53.


The sequestration of sub-saturated OSA in water at less than 200ppm by conversion into solid
silica structures, such as phytoliths, in plants is called biosilicification. As in the case of maize,
this conversion is catalyzed by callose made by plants in response to injury, including aluminum
toxicity^50 ,5^4. The resulting structures are biosilicified mirror images of the cellular and
subcellular parts of the plant on which they are deposited. When looked at in a microscope, after
staining for silica, the structures look breathtakingly beautiful. An example is the picture of three
biosilicified stomata on a distal stem of horsetail as shown in Figure 650.


### Biosilifications - an Aluminum Filter for Air-Plants

The stomata of plants are small ports through which plants breathe by transpiring oxygen, carbon
dioxide, and water vapor and by reverse-transpiring water vapor and liquid hygroscopic aerosols
that collect on plant leaves^55. Hydraulic activation of stomata allows bidirectional liquid aerosol
transport between leaf surface and leaf interior^56. Aerosols have always been a component of the
earth’s atmosphere and plant surfaces are a major aerosol sink. Aerosols that have collected on
leaves can contain nutrients, such as OSA, that are transferred through the stomata to the interior
of the leaves^56. Also, aerosols can contain phytotoxic chemicals, such as aluminum.

The stomata in some plants, such as the bird’s-nest fern (Asplenium nidus), are rich in callose
and as a result become sites for silica deposition^5 0,5^7. Polymeric OSA has a high affinity for
aluminum^30 and when deposited as insoluble silica around the stomata of plants it makes every
stoma an aluminum filter (see Figure 6). This is useful for the bird’s-nest fern as it is an air-plant
(a.k.a. epiphyte) growing on another plant, such as a tree but not deriving sustenance from the
tree. When the bird’s nest fern collects airborne nutrient containing aerosols on its leaves, it uses
deposited silica to filter any aluminum before it is transferred through the stomata into the leaf.

Phytoliths from the wood and leaves of sub-alpine plant species were found in 72% of the cases
to contain a significant percentage of hydroxyaluminosilicate^58. This underscores the
commonality of plants using OSA and biosilifications for aluminum detoxification.

Plants have evolved to protect themselves from phytotoxic aluminum by detoxifying and
sequestering aluminum in apoplasts and biosilifications, such as phytoliths. This only works in
areas where there is available OSA in the soil. In some areas of the world with OSA deficient
soil, OSA is currently used as a fertilizer to ultimately provide plants with protection from
phytotoxic aluminum^44.


### Silica Water Protects Animals

I am an avid fisherman and love catching and releasing trout. Some years ago I spotted a small
remote pond from a mountain top in New Hampshire. After some hiking and route finding,
involving map and compass, I arrived at the pond but there appeared to be no trout in the pond.
Remarkably there was a limnologist studying this pond. After surprisingly appearing out of the
brush along the edge of the pond, he pointed out that there were no trout in this pond due to acid
rain. The acid rain had liberated a toxin out of the rock and soil around the pond and this toxin
had killed the fish and other aquatic life in the pond. By his analysis of the pond’s water,
aluminum ions were the toxin.

Aluminum ions in water at a concentration of 35 0 ppb and a pH of 5.5 kills fish in 48 hours by
damaging their gills and preventing the fish from getting oxygen from water^59. In 19 89 it was
reported by Birchall et al. that OSA detoxifies 350 ppb of aluminum. To prove this OSA at twice
the concentration of aluminum in water (2mM OSA and 1mM aluminum) was diluted 77-fold
resulting in a solution that contained 35 0 ppb of aluminum and 2.5ppm of OSA. This solution did
not kill fish at pH 5.5^59. Exley, et al., also proved that HASB formed at pH 5.5 under these same
conditions was nontoxic to fish^60. This work demonstrated that OSA can passively protect fish in
water polluted with aluminum.

The lives of animals are both passively and actively protected from aluminum toxicity by OSA.
Animals on earth have evolved the ability to actively accumulate OSA in order to protect them
from aluminum poisoning. This evolution started millions of years ago in primitive animals, such
as snails. Snails (Lymnaea stagnalis), when exposed to 5 55ppb of aluminum and 0. 158 ppm of
OSA in water, increase their level of OSA in intracellular organelles, called lysosomes, as
compared with snails not exposed to aluminum. This results in aluminum detoxification by
sequestration in lysosomal granules of digestive cells in the digestive gland of snails^61.

The ratio of silicon to aluminum is 1:2.3 in snail lysosomes indicating that the aluminum has
been detoxified to HASA^61. Since the level of OSA in the snail’s water is too low for HASA to
form prior to entry into the lysosome, snails actively increase the OSA level in their lysosomes to
a level sufficient to form HASA in response to aluminum in their water.


In higher animals, such as rats, Carlisle and Curran at UCLA School of Public Health found that
when rats were fed a supplemental aluminum with low OSA diet, 23-month-old rats had not
accumulated aluminum in their brains, while 28-month rats had accumulated aluminum in their
brains. Both 23-month-old and 28-month-old rats fed a supplemental aluminum with high OSA
diet, did not accumulate aluminum in their brains^62. This observation is indicative of OSA either
facilitating the excretion of aluminum or impairing the sequestration of aluminum in the aging
rat brain. They concluded^62 :

_“Dietary silicon_ supplementation thus appeared to be protective against aluminum accumulation
_in an ageing brain.”_

In an effort to confirm Carlisle and Curran’s findings, supplemental aluminum, as aluminum
nitrate, was given to young rats (21 days old), adult rats (8 months old), and old rats (16 months
old). The aluminum was administered by gavage (i.e., through a tube to the stomach) daily for
6.5 months and then the animal’s brains were analyzed for aluminum accumulation. Contrary to
Carlisle and Curran’s findings, rats of all ages accumulated aluminum in their brains^63. The
olfactory bulb of the brain had the highest aluminum levels.

In an effort to find if accumulated aluminum as found in the organs of rats decreased with OSA
supplementation, rats were simultaneously given both supplemental OSA and aluminum.
Patterning OSA dosages after Carlisle and Curran^62 , supplemental synthetic OSA was given to
rats for 5 weeks and concurrently supplemental aluminum was given by gavage for just 5 days a
week for 5 weeks^64. This OSA treatment decreases both the prior accumulated aluminum, as
measured in the control animals, and ingested supplemental aluminum in four organs and six
regions of the brain^64. Table 1 summarizes this important, remarkable, and disturbing data.

The most important point of Table 1 is comparing the control data, representing aluminum
accumulated prior the start of the experiment (column 2), and the amounts of aluminum
remaining after supplementation with 200 and 400ppm OSA (columns 4 and 5). Note after OSA
supplementation the accumulated aluminum is reduced in all organs and regions of the
brain even in spite of aluminum supplementation! This result shows the power of OSA to
purge the body of accumulated aluminum in a matter of weeks.


### Importance:

- In every tissue and organ tested, including bone and six regions of brain, the prior
    accumulated aluminum is reversed by supplemental OSA.
- Aluminum accumulation is possibly an adverse effect of aging.
- Both rats and humans are mammals and what happens in rats is usually also true for
    humans.

### Remarkable:

- The reversal in aluminum accumulation is dose dependent averaging 58% with 200ppm
    of OSA and 7 9 % with 400ppm of supplemental OSA.
- OSA at twice its saturation level in water (i.e., 400ppm) is more effective at lowering
    aluminum accumulation than at its 200ppm saturation level. This implies that insoluble
    OSA oligomers (i.e., short polymers), formed in supersaturated OSA, may bind to some
    of the supplemental aluminum in the gut preventing aluminum absorption^30.
- There is less aluminum in urine with 200ppm OSA supplementation than without
    200ppm OSA supplementation. Therefore, because OSA at 200ppm does not form
    oligomers, OSA monomers must also bind to some of the supplemental aluminum in the
    gut preventing aluminum absorption^64.

### Disturbing:

- Aluminum accumulation in young rats indicates that early stages of the life cycle allow
    aluminum accumulation in the brain, such as seen in children with autism who
    accumulate more aluminum in their brains than children without autism^63 ,^65.
- Highest aluminum accumulation in the olfactory bulb suggests aluminum nitrate in water
    was inhaled during or immediately after gavage. This may be a preferred route of entry
    into the brain, possibly because it is a shortcut that avoids the blood-brain-barrier^66 -^69.


A certain minimal dose of OSA in water administered over a sufficient period of time is required
to increase the elimination of aluminum and lower aluminum absorption in rats and humans. For
instance, Volvic water (51 ppm OSA) was given as drinking water to rats for one week. At the 5-
day point both aluminum- 26 (i.e., a radioactive isotope of aluminum) and 0. 2 cc of Volvic water
were given to the rats by gavage. In this experiment OSA did not increase aluminum- 26
elimination in the urine or lower aluminum- 26 accumulation in the bones of rats^70. Likewise,
only 1 dose of 0.6 liters of synthetic 187ppm OSA given to 5 human volunteers resulted in
increased aluminum excretion occurring simultaneously with peak silica excretion but at a level
too small to be significant^71. These results suggest that when silica water is administered in
too low a volume or for too short a time, there will be no observable benefit. In contrast it
has been observed that 1.5 liters of Volvic water drunk within 1 hour is sufficient to enhance
aluminum elimination in humans as described it the next section of this chapter.

Independent of OSA’s ability to protect animals from aluminum toxicity, the essentiality of
silicon in animals has been established by a series of experiments^72 :

- Silicon was shown to be localized in bone growth areas of young mice and rats
- Silicon is required for normal growth and skeletal development in chicks
- Silicon is required for bone growth and skull formation in rats


Animal protection from toxic aluminum by OSA is both passive and active. Snails actively
sequester OSA for aluminum protection. Fish passively derive gill protection from OSA in
water. Rats passively benefit from OSA and OSA oligomers in drinking water that bind with
aluminum in the gut, preventing absorption, and facilitating aluminum excretion in feces and
urine. Rats may actively transport OSA to the kidney lumen and urine in order to prevent
aluminum reabsorption into the blood. Aluminum stores in organs and tissues are in a dynamic
equilibrium. Supplemental OSA dramatically shifts this equilibrium in favor of aluminum
elimination from organs and tissues and into the urine for excretion.

It is now generally accepted that silicon, as OSA, is an essential nutritional trace element for
animals^72. But until recently the essentiality for humans had not been established. In humans,
loss of silicon with ageing is linked to loss of tissue flexibility^72 :

- Silicon content of the human aorta and other arterial vessels declines with age leading to
    less flexibility
- Silicon content of the human arterial wall declines in parallel with atherosclerosis (a.k.a.
    hardening of the arteries)
- Silicon content of skin declines leading to wrinkling

Over millions of years plant and animals have evolved protective mechanisms using OSA to
actively and passively protect themselves from aluminum toxicity. But with arrival of the
aluminum age these protective mechanisms have become insufficient to handle the increasing
levels of aluminum in the environment. As an example, humans are susceptible to mismatch
diseases in which our body’s evolved defenses for aluminum are not up to the task of protecting
us. This results in mismatch diseases such as Alzheimer’s, autism, cardiovascular disease (i.e.,
chronic heart disease and stroke), Parkinson’s, and multiple sclerosis.

Also, in humans declining blood OSA levels with ageing may be linked to an increase in
aluminum absorption in the old and elderly. The essentiality of OSA for active aluminum
protection for humans is addressed in the next section of Chapter 2.


### Silica Water Protects Humans

In humans the complexation of OSA with aluminum hydroxide dimer to form HASB can occur in
the duodenum (pH 5.8-6.7), blood (pH 7.4), kidney lumen, (pH 6 .5 to 8.0), and across the blood-
brain-barrier in the cerebrospinal fluid (pH 7.33). In addition, it has been shown in a human test
that at least 3.6% of ingested OSA goes inside cells within 2 hours of ingestion and has an
intracellular half-life of 11 hours^481. During this time complexation of OSA with aluminum can
occur inside human cells that are normally at pH 6.8 to 7.4. The formation of HASB protects
humans from aluminum toxicity by facilitating the excretion of aluminum in urine, feces, and
perspiration^73 ,^74. It has been shown that a diet that includes a mineral water high in OSA
facilitates both the urination and perspiration pathways for aluminum excretion^75.

The best way to measure the effect of OSA on aluminum excretion is to feed humans radioactive
ionic aluminum- 26 with and without OSA supplementation and follow its level in blood plasma
and urine over a period of time. This test is risky for volunteers who participate, as aluminum- 26
decays so energetically that its recommend storage is in a chamber lined with 2 inches of lead^76.
In spite of this danger, J. A. Edwardson in 1993 found that OSA (100uM/L = 96ppm) in orange
juice laced with isotopic aluminum-26 lowers human blood plasma levels by 10 - fold on average
compared with the same human volunteers drinking aluminum-26 laced orange juice without
OSA^77. This data is on the left in Figure 7. In order to measure how quickly absorbed aluminum
is excreted in the urine, a healthy volunteer’s aluminum level in urine was measured hourly after
drinking 1.5 liters of 51 ppm OSA in Volvic water^78. This data is on the right in Figure 7.

Silica water enriched with OSA can be made synthetically by diluting and acidifying sodium
silicate and purchased as either silica rich bottled drinking water or beer with and without
alcohol. All of these sources of OSA have been tested for their ability to enhance aluminum
excretion by measuring aluminum-26 or aluminum-28 in blood plasma or urine as summarized
in Table 2. Ingesting synthetic or natural OSA demonstrates that in both cases there is similar
bioavailability of OSA30,^79 ,^80. Also in both cases after drinking OSA rich water the amount of
aluminum in the blood and excreted in the urine reaches a maximum after several hours and then
declines (see Figure 7 )77,78.


Left Graph **–** Aluminum- 26 levels in blood: Five healthy volunteers (A-E) first drank orange
juice containing aluminum-26 without OSA and (solid lines) then several days later drank the
same aluminum-26 laced orange juice with OSA (dashed lines)^77. Right Graph **–** Aluminum
divided by creatinine levels in urine: One healthy volunteer drank 1.5 liters of OSA ( 51 ppm)
and then repeated the test approx. 1 week later by drinking another 1.5 liters of OSA ( 51 ppm)^78.


The date in Table 2 is consistent with OSA facilitating an enhanced excretion of accumulated
aluminum in the urine^80. Enhanced urinary excretion of aluminum occurs within hours of
ingesting OSA. With continued ingestion of OSA over three months, accumulated aluminum is
significantly decreased in the body^73. The data in Table 2 proves that the source of OSA, be it
either synthetic, such as silicate, or natural, such as Spritzer or beer, does not matter as
OSA from all these sources enhances aluminum excretion.

The duodenum is the primary site of aluminum absorption in the gastrointestinal tract of rats and
humans^81. Human duodenal pH is 5.8 to 6.5 during fasting and 6.0 to 6.7 while eating and the
kidney lumen is pH 6.5 to 8.0.^82. Therefore, OSA can react with aluminum hydroxide dimer in
both the duodenum and the kidney lumen to form HASB and thereby prevent both aluminum and
OSA from being absorbed from the duodenum into the blood and reabsorbed from the urine into
blood. From the data in the plot on the left side of Figure 7 , some humans given supplemental
OSA excrete 3 times more aluminum than others^77. This indicates the possibility of active OSA
sequestration in the kidney lumen that varies among individuals.

OSA also facilitates the excretion of aluminum in human perspiration^74. Before drinking OSA
rich water males and females age 20- 22 who are excercising excrete the same concentration of
aluminum in sweat as shown in Table 374. After drinking OSA rich water both males and females
excrete 1.5 to 2.4 fold higher levels of aluminum than before drinking OSA rich water as shown
in Table 3^74. However, males excrete more aluminum than females because males at age 18- 24
have greater sweat gland output than females^83 ,8^4. Note that the volume of sweat per day (e.g., 3
to 4 liters an hour while excercising) can exceed the volume of urine per day (i.e., less than 2
liters/day).


Kristien Van Dyke in 2000 measured the OSA content of blood serum in different aged
individuals^85. Dr. Van Dyke found very high levels of OSA in infants less than a year old and
extremely low levels in pregnant mothers. This data is diagrammed in Figure 8. Dr. Van Dyke
came to a startling conclusion:

_“The explanation of the high_ silicon levels of the infant group, especially <1yr., may be that
_pregnant mothers offer their silicon to the growing fetus ...”_

The soluble silicon in the blood serum is OSA and there is also OSA in breastmilk. Tanaka in
1990 found levels of silicon in breastmilk of 47 0 to 670mcg/liter from 1 week to 1 month of
birth^21. These findings suggest that OSA is a nutrient that mothers have evolved to supply to the
fetus and infant. OSA not only lowers levels of absorbed aluminum in the brain62,64 but also
improves bone mineral density and strength^86 -^88.

### Conclusion of Silica Water for Protection from Aluminum

It is amazing that plants, animals, and humans all use OSA, a naturally occurring molecule, to
provide protection from aluminum toxicity. It is equally amazing that mother’s give their OSA
to their fetuses and infants to provide protection from aluminum. This discovery elevates the
importance of OSA to that of an essential nutrient in humans^85. In conclusion from the very
simple life forms, such as diatoms and radiolarians, to very complex organisms, such as
humans, OSA has been found to play essential roles.


## Chapter 3 – Silica Water for Healthy Longevity

```
“If there is magic on this planet, it is contained in the water.”
Loren C. Eiseley – The Immense Journey 1946
```
In my first book on preventing Alzheimer’s disease and atherosclerosis by using OSA in
drinking water to lower chronic aluminum toxicity there was no mention that this could also
result in increased longevity^1. However, these diseases do shorten the lives of a large percentage
of the worldwide population. But does drinking OSA rich silica water actually increase
longevity?

This question was on my mind when I met the author Martha R. A. Fields at the local library
sponsored author’s day. Martha was originally from Okinawa and explained that Okinawans live
longer than Japanese and much longer than those in the U.S.A. She was most fascinated with the
fact that Okinawans have an ikigai (pronounced “ick-ee-guy”) that means a reason for being.
This more purposeful approach to work and life is believed to result in longevity. I became
fascinated when she mentioned that extensive research had been conducted on Okinawans. My
detective instincts started my journey as I wondered if in general do Okinawans both have an
ikigai and drink OSA rich silica water.

There are hot spots of longevity on earth that have been identified by demographers who
carefully checked through birth and death records. These geographic regions are called longevity
regions in this book. Demographers circled at least one of these geographic regions with blue ink
on a map and for this reason they called it a blue region^120. In these regions, when compared with
surrounding regions, there are higher concentrations of 100-year-olds (centenarians) and higher
probability of 60 - 79 - year-olds in 1970 surviving to 90+ by year 2000 (see Table 3 )^2. The people
of these regions have less dementia, heart disease, certain cancers, and osteoporosis accounting
for their longevity.


By 20 22 six longevity regions have been identified:

- Okinawa, Japan – The largest island in a subtropical archipelago that has the world’s
    longest-lived women.
- Villagrande, Sardinia – A small mountainous region on an island off the coast of Italy
    with the world’s highest concentration of male centenarians.
- Ikaria, Greece – An island off the coast of Greece in the Aegean Sea that has one of the
    lowest rates of middle age mortality in the world and the lowest rate of dementia in the
    world.
- Nicoya Peninsula, Costa Rica – A region where residents have one of lowest rates of
    middle age mortality in the world and the second highest concentration of male
    centenarians.
- Loma Linda, California – City with the highest concentration of Seventh-day
    Adventists in the U.S.A. where they live ten years longer than the average American.
- Western Hechi, China – A three county area with much higher centenarian density and
    more than double the likelihood of reaching 90 years of age than three boarding counties
    to the east.

In Table 4 the male and female survival rates are the percentage of people 60 to 79 who will
make it to age 90 in each country and longevity region. The longevity index is the percentage of
people 65 to 89 who will make it to age 90. This table shows that either male and female survival
rates or the longevity index is higher in longevity regions than each of their nearby areas. The
table also shows that all longevity regions sit either atop or near silica rich substrates that results
in silica rich water used for both drinking and crop irrigation. The longevity regions provide us
with clues as to why people who live there live longer. Higher than normal levels of silica in
drinking water are more than a clue; they are a loud and clear message that silica water can
prevent and heal diseases that shorten our lives, such as Alzheimer’s, cardiovascular disease
(e.g., heart disease and stroke), some cancers, osteoporosis, and multiple sclerosis.



### Okinawa, Japan

Okinawan Centenarian Study - The Japanese Ministry of Health became interested in the
extreme longevity of Okinawan’s and began the Okinawan Centenarian Study in 1975. It is
currently the world’s longest continuously running study of centenarians. World-wide interest in
the Okinawan longevity region began in 1979 when Shigechiyo Izuma was crowned the world’s
ultimate survivor in the game of life by the Guinness Book of World Records. At age 115 he was
claimed to be the oldest human in the world. He lived in the Kagoshima Prefecture that includes
Okinawa and had led a robust and productive life retiring as a farmer at 105 and ultimately lived
to 120. His life-story interested people around the world who wanted to emulate him.

Although the Guinness Book of World records continues to regard Mr. Izuma as the oldest man
ever documented^89 , investigation by Japanese demographers revealed, in all likelihood, Mr.
Izuma had “inherited” his first name and with it the prior census data from an older deceased
sibling. Mr. Izuma was actually 10 years younger than he claimed^90. But amazingly he did live
to 110. This case of misrepresentation underscores the importance of careful verification in
identifying longevity regions.

Okinawan Longevity Region Verification **–** The longevity regions and their centenarians
attract world-wide attention that ultimately brings in tourist dollars. For this reason, there are
many “want-to-be” longevity regions but to qualify there must be a published systematic
validation of centenarian prevalence. In 2006 The Japanese Ministry of Health scientists
performed comprehensive age validation on a subset (8%) of the total Okinawan centenarian
population^91. Careful scrutiny of birth and death records and other age-related documents is
necessary to support longevity claims. Demographers confirmed there were four times as many
Okinawan centenarians per capita than those on the Japanese mainland. In 2006 Okinawa had
740 centenarians of which 84 % were women in a population of 1.3 million^91 ,^92.


Why Okinawa is a Longevity Region - From 197 4 to 2006 the number of centenarians in
Okinawa grew 300-fold (see Figure 9 ) while the population only grew 1.3-fold from 1 million to
1.3 million^93. In order to discover what was causing this rise in longevity the Ministry of Health
gerontologists conducted the largest double-blind study evaluating factors considered at the time
to contribute to longevity including: exercise, genetics, diet, caloric restriction, stress reduction,
and other lifestyle habits. Results of this study found some unquantifiable but relevant
differences between Okinawan’s and mainland Japanese:

- Okinawan’s in general do have an ikigai or sense of purpose.
- Okinawan centenarians have maintained an average body mass index (BMI) that ranges
    from 18 to 22, with lean being less than 23. Eating fewer calories has been shown to keep
    BMI low and increase lifespan^94. Also drinking OSA rich water lowers BMI^1.
- Okinawan centenarians maintain social bonds with small groups of friends for life.
- Okinawan centenarians have genetic polymorphisms of the human leukocyte antigen
    (HLA) gene that place them at lower risk for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases^95.

These cultural and genetic differences between Okinawa and mainland Japan had existed well
over a century before 1974 and unlikely account for the rapid rise in centenarians after 1974.
However, the most important clues to Okinawan longevity are the very low mortality risks from


cardiovascular disease (e.g., heart disease and stroke), dementia, and certain cancers on
Okinawa. These terminal diseases are major causes of death worldwide and aluminum has been
shown to be a causal factor^1.

Heart Disease - Researchers found that Okinawans have low homocysteine as compared to
westerners. This low homocysteine may account for why Okinawans have less atherosclerotic
narrowing and calcification and an 80% reduced risk for coronary heart disease compared to
westerners. An autopsy of a 100-year-old Okinawan women in 2004 revealed normal age-
associated changes in her heart but remarkably her coronary vessels were free of atherosclerotic
narrowing and calcification^96. Autopsy reports on non-Okinawan centenarians show coronary
vessel narrowing in 66% of centenarians and coronary calcification in 84 to 97% of
centenarians^97 ,^98.

High levels of plasma homocysteine are correlated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease
including stroke and atherosclerosis (a.k.a. hardening of the arteries)^1. Homocysteine is a causal
factor of atherosclerosis^1. Aluminum ions increase plasma total homocysteine by inhibiting the
activation of an enzyme (i.e., methionine synthase) that converts homocysteine to harmless
methionine. Insulin-like growth factor normally stimulates methionine synthase. But aluminum
ions inhibit this stimulation at levels found in vivo (i.e., biphasic: 50% inhibition at 2.7 parts per
trillion equivalent to 0.1 nano moles per liter and 50% inhibition at 2.7 parts per billion)^100 ,10^1.


Dementia - A prevalence survey showed even in their late 90s Okinawans had lower dementia
rates than comparable populations in both the U.S.A. and Japan^102.

The most common types of dementia are vascular dementia (e.g., vascular disease and stroke)
and Alzheimer’s disease. Aluminum is a causal factor for both of these types of dementia^1.

Cancer **–** In 1996 Okinawans had 50% less breast and prostate cancer than mainland Japanese
and more than 80% less breast and prostate cancer than recorded in the U.S.A. per 100,000
people (see Table 5 )^105 ,^106.

The risk of breast and prostate cancer is significantly increased if the BRCA1 tumor suppression
gene’s expression is reduced, eliminated, or corrupted by a germ cell mutation^107. Germ cells
when fully developed become sperm or ovum. BRCA1 expression is reduced or undetectable in


the majority of high grade, ductal breast cancers^108. When expressed, BRCA1 produces a breast
cancer type 1 susceptibility protein called BRCA1. This protein is responsible for error-free
repair of double-strand breaks in DNA. When DNA is not repaired properly, there is an
increased risk of cancer^109. Aluminum ions lower the expression of BRCA1 and thereby increase
the risk of breast and prostate cancer^110 ,^111. OSA in drinking water facilitates the elimination of
aluminum in urine and perspiration preventing the development of breast and prostate cancer.

Okinawan Drinking Water - Professor Jun Kobayashi of Okayama University, who had been
studying the water of Japan and globally for 40 years, suggested Okinawan longevity might be
due to the unique drinking water in Okinawa. Unlike some of the other islands of Japan that
formed as a result of volcanos, Okinawa was formed from limestones. These limestones contain
high levels of calcium silicate (Ca 2 SiO 4 ) a silicate dissolvable as OSA, not insoluble silica (SiO 2 )
in quartz and mica as found in plutonic granite from volcanic activity^14. When it rains on
Okinawa, the water filters through the limestone formation being enriched with minerals, such as
OSA. The water Okinawans drink, give to their animals, and water their gardens is rich in OSA.

Okinawan drinking water sources and the percentage of drinking water they supply in 2014^16 :

- River water reservoirs 81%
- River water 12%
- Groundwater 6.4%
- Converted seawater 0.7%

Northern Okinawa is mountainous and the location of most of the island’s rivers. Therefore,
dams and reservoirs are situated in northern regions and this water is supplied to the southern
part of the island that has a larger population density. There are three limestones in the Ryukyu
Island Archipelago: Naha, Yontan, and Machinato. Naha Limestone has the highest percentage
of calcium silicate of the three limestones and coral as shown in Table 6. Okinawa Island rests on
a 50-meter-thick layer of Naha Limestone that is exposed up to elevations of approximately 170
meters^15. Because calcium silicate in limestone is 0.01% soluble in water, the springs, streams,


and rivers in contact with this limestone are enriched with OSA^14. The primary component of all
three of these limestones is calcium carbonate (a.k.a. calcite) that is only soluble in weak acids^14.
Therefore, in rain or spring water near neutrality, primarily the calcium silicate dissolves.

The river waters in the northern Kunigami District of Okinawa have low conductivity (less than
150 uS/cm) and therefore low carbonate levels^112. The river waters in the southern Shimajiri
District of Okinawa have high conductivity (400 to 900uS/cm) and high carbonate levels^112.
Low conductivity river waters in northern Okinawa are considered “non-carbonate waters” and
have much more dissolved silicate than river waters in southern Okinawa as shown in Table 714.

Since most Okinawans live in the southern part of the island, they drank water with low levels of
dissolved silica until a water system was developed to supply northern river and reservoir water
to the south. The first Okinawan water system with aqueduct, pumping station, and water
treatment began supplying northern water to 3,000 locations in 1933. In 1944 the water supply
facility was destroyed in World War II and not reopened until 1951. One of the largest reservoirs
in the water supply system is the Fukuji Reservoir located in Northern Kunigami District of
Okinawa. This reservoir began supplying drinking water to Okinawans in 1974. The water
conductivity of the Fukuji Reservoir varies seasonally from 110 to 144/uS/cm^112. These water
conductivities indicate that this reservoir is filled with low carbonate and high silicate water and
has approximately 40ppm per liter of dissolved OSA^14.


Okinawans had the highest survival rates to age 90 of any other longevity region: male 6.6% and
female 16.3%^2. Looking at the history of Okinawa’s water system it is likely that these survivors
drank 40ppm silica water from 1951 until they eventually died. Professor Kobayashi was right
when he postulated that a major factor in Okinawan longevity is in their drinking water. It is
very likely that this factor is OSA. OSA facilitates the elimination of aluminum thereby
removing from the body a causal factor for cardiovascular disease, vascular dementia,
Alzheimer’s disease, breast and prostate cancer^1.

Okinawan Hip Fractures **–** Hip fractures are considered a terminal disease because in the
elderly they usually result in permanent immobility and associated health complications.
Okinawans have 20% fewer hip fractures than do mainland Japanese and about 40% fewer hip
fractures than Americans^113. The rate of bone mineral density loss was compared between
Okinawans and mainland Japanese. It was discovered that for women older than 40 and men
older than 50, mainland Japanese lose more calcium from their bones than Okinawans^114. The
higher bone density in older Okinawans is likely due to high levels of OSA in their drinking
water. OSA supplementation has been shown to improve bone mineral density by both
inhibiting bone mass loss and stimulating bone formation in humans^86 -^88 and rats^115 -^117.

Japanese Drinking Water **–** Is 40ppm of silicate in the drinking water of Okinawa substantially
higher than levels of silicate in drinking water on the Japanese mainland? In order to answer this
question, we must first define what is mainland Japan. Japan consists of a number of islands the
largest of which is called Honshu or “Main Island”. Eighty percent of the population of Japan
lives on Honshu.

There are two papers that address silica levels in drinking water of Honshu12,13. The accuracy
and comparability of the data in these two papers was confirmed in two ways. First both papers
measured OSA in commercially available Volvic water by either Coradin’s yellow or blue
procedures^29. Secondly, I measured OSA in Volvic water using Coradin’s blue procedure (see
Appendix IV)^1. All three measurements indicate that Volvic water has 48 ppm of OSA within a
variation of 3 ppm. The Honshu drinking water data is given by prefecture and adjusted for the
population of each prefecture in Table 8. There is on average 26ppm of OSA in tap water on the
Japanese mainland of Honshu. This is below the 40ppm of OSA in tap water of Okinawa.


Okinawa is not the only southern island in Japan with high levels of OSA in their drinking water.
The Kagoshima Prefecture in the southwest corner of Kyushu Island also has high levels of OSA
in their drinking water. For example, two cities in this Prefecture, Kagoshima City and Kirishima
City, have 100ppm and 126ppm of OSA in their drinking water respectively^13. The average OSA
in tap water taken at 12 sites in the Kagoshima Prefecture on Kyushu was 85ppm^13. The
Kagoshima Prefecture deserves study as an undiscovered but potential longevity region. The
Kagoshima Prefecture extends south to Okinawa and includes a number of smaller islands in the
Ryukyu Island Archipelago. One of these small islands is Kikaijima that is approximately half-
way between Okinawa and Kyushu.

Kikaijima Island in the Kagoshima Prefecture is where Nabi Tajima lived when on September
15 th 2017 she became the oldest person on earth! Nabi was born on August 4th 1900 in the
town of Araki in the western most part of Kikaijima Island. She lived her later life in the city of
Kikai located on Kikaijima Island. Her age was validated by the Guinness Book of World
Records. Nabi became a member of an exclusive group of 46 supercentenarians on earth who
were over 110 years old in September of 2017. Nabi died on April 21st 2018 at the age of 117.


Conclusion of Okinawa Longevity Region- A longevity region is an area of the world where
people have a statistically better chance of living beyond 90 than those living just outside the
longevity region. A litmus test for longevity regions is an area where there is a higher density of
centenarians in the population. Okinawa passed this litmus test in 1975. The Okinawan
Centenarian Study started in 1975 and began looking at why the people of Okinawa have been
able to avoid common terminal diseases unlike mainland Japan and the U.S.A. They found that
four diseases that increase the risk of mortality were significantly reduced in Okinawa:

- Cardiovascular disease as evidenced by low levels of plasma homocysteine
- Cancer as evidence by low rates of breast and prostate cancer
- Dementia as evidenced by low rates of Alzheimer’s disease
- Higher bone density as evidenced by lower incidence of hip fracture

Aluminum is a likely causal factor of all of these diseases (see Chapter 5). Silica water, as OSA
in drinking water, has been shown to facilitate aluminum elimination^73. One of the largest
epidemiology studies performed to date has shown that OSA in drinking water lowers the risk of
Alzheimer’s disease^118. OSA in drinking water has been shown to improve bone mineral density
by both inhibiting bone mass loss and stimulating bone formation in humans^86 -^88 and rats^115 -^117.

Table 9 compares the level of OSA in drinking water with health statistics in Okinawa, mainland
Japan, and the U.S.A. indicating that higher OSA leads to better health and greater longevity.

My chance meeting with Martha R. A. Fields at the local library and this data on Okinawa
motivated me to continue my detective work examining the levels of OSA in the drinking water
of the other longevity regions. In the next sections of Chapter 3 data on OSA levels of drinking
water in the other longevity regions is discussed.


### Sardinia and Villagrande, Italy

Sardinia, Italy is a beautiful island in the Mediterranean Sea off the west coast of the Italian
mainland. The interior of the island is mountainous and dry. Since the Bronze Age one of the
problems with living in this region is the insufficient supply of water. In Sardinia demographers
have identified two regions that have a higher density of centenarians than normal in Italy.

- Sardinia longevity region – the entire island
- Villagrande super-longevity region – 14 villages including Villagrande

The Ogliastra is the most mountainous province in Sardinia and the least populous province of
Italy with only 57,642 inhabitants. This region is on the Tyrrhenian Sea in eastern Sardinia and
hosts some of the most beautiful landscapes in the world. In 2016 the Ogliastra Province was
abolished and almost all of its 23 cities joined the Province of Nuoro. There are now 74 villages
in the Province of Nuoro. The inner mountainous area of the former Ogliastra Province is the
southern part of Barbagia. The people of Barbagia live on the slopes of the Supremonte
Mountains and work as sheep herders and farmers.

The village of Villagrande is 5 0km south southeast of the city of Nuoro. The people of southern
Barbagia living in 14 villages, including Villagrande, have extreme longevity when compared to
the longevity of Sardinian people. This is impressive because Sardinian males have nearly twice
the longevity of Italians living on the mainland in Italy (see Table 4 ). Possibly even more
impressive is the fact that people living in Barbagia are some of the poorest people in Italy.

Sardinian Centenarian Validation - A traditional Sardinian greeting is “A Kent’Annos” or the
acronym “AKEA” that means “a hundred years”. In 1999 the AKEA I study of Sardinia’s
centenarians identified 233 potentially eligible centenarians who were born from 1880 to
1900119. In order to validate these centenarians a multidimensional home interview was
conducted of 141 of the 233 potentially eligible centenarians and their locations in 1999 are
indicated with black and gray solid-colored dots on map on the left of Figure 12. The locations
of those not interviewed are indicated with black and gray circles on the map on the left of
Figure 12. From this data it is apparent that most of the centenarians live in the central
mountainous region of Sardinia.


Villagrande Centenarian Validation **–** The data from the AKEA I study was used to identify
an area in the Province of Nuoro for the AKEA II Nuoro centenarian validation study. This area
has the highest probability of any one born to reach 100 years of age (called the Extreme
Longevity Index or ELI)^120. This super-longevity region is in the vicinity and to the northeast of
Villagrande, including 13 other villages in Southern Barbagia and the former Ogliastra Province.
These villages are in the most mountainous area in Sardinia. The total population of the area at
the time of the study was approximately 40,000. The inhabitants were engaged in pastoral and
agricultural activities and followed a relatively traditional life style. During 1880 to 1900,
17,965 people were born in the Villagrande super-longevity region and 91 of these people (47
men and 44 women) would reach the age of 100. The age of each centenarian was validated
according to accepted rules and criteria2,1^20. The approximate 1 to 1 ratio of female to male
centenarians in this super-longevity region is unique as the ratio is usually closer to 5 to 1 as it is
in Okinawa^121.


Sardinian Drinking Water **–** Currently ninety percent of the drinking water in Sardinia comes
from approximately 40 artificial lakes made by damming the rivers of the island. Data collected
over many decades have shown most of these lakes are eutrophic and dominated by
cyanobacteria^122. In the mountains of Sardinia these artificial lakes were filled with a mixture of
water from springs and limited surface water runoff. There are two types of springs in this area:

- Karst Springs
- Thermal Springs

Karst springs are fed from relatively shallow aquifers and underground streams mixed with
some surface water runoff^123. Karst springs usually supply drinking water with less than 10ppm
of OSA and can be contaminated with animal and human waste^124.

An example of karst springs is the Su Gologone springs, Sa Vena and Sa Vena Manna. They are
in the Gulf of Orosi karst area covering more than 210 square miles^123. These springs are fed
from the Supramonte Aquifer that is located under the Guthiddai Valley at the northeastern foot
of Mount Udde (806m)^124. Water from the Sa Vena spring supplies drinking water to
approximately16,000 inhabitants of the villages of Oliena and Dorgali^124. The waters from these
springs were tested from December 2010 to June of 2011 and found to contain on average
6.5ppm of OSA^124. The flow rate of this spring is seasonally variable from 120 liters/sec during
low flow to 5,000 liters/sec during normal floods^125.

Thermal Springs are fed from deep geothermal waters that well up to the surface in the area of
geological faults. Before the construction of dams creating artificial lakes, thermal springs were
desirable for drinking water as they were less susceptible to both seasonal flow variation and
surface runoff contamination than karst springs. OSA in thermal springs in Sardinia is on
average 41 to 62ppm as shown in Table 10. Thermal springs in Sardinia vary in water
temperature from 15 to 58oC (60 to 136oF)^10. The lower levels of OSA in some rivers of
Sardinia are due to karst springs and surface runoff from rain diluting the OSA from thermal
springs that flow into rivers.


There are two sources of OSA in the thermal springs of Sardinia: Late Mesozoic\Eosene
limestone in East-Central Sardinia and alluvial deposits in the area of the Campidano and
Capoterra faults in Southwestern Sardinia^34. In East-Central Sardinia the most likely source of
OSA is diatom fossils in the upper layers of the Late Mesozoic\Eosene limestone plate (shaded
as brick-work on the map in the left of Figure 13 ). After the extinction of dinosaurs 66 million
years ago diatoms diversified and multiplied in the world’s oceans becoming the dominate-sink
for OSA in the oceans at the expense of other organisms that require OSA, including both the
radiolarian and reef-building sponge population^126 ,^127. Therefore, this limestone, like Naha
Limestone in Okinawa, is high in silicate and low in aluminum as described in the next section of
this chapter on Villagrande drinking water.


Villagrande Drinking Water **–** Like the Naha limestone in Northern Okinawa, the late
Mesozoic\Eocene limestone plate underlies the Villagrande super-longevity region providing this
area with OSA rich drinking water (see Figure 13 and Table 10 ). Although there are numerous
OSA rich thermal springs in Sardinia, this late Mesozoic\Eocene limestone adjacent to faults is
unique to the super-longevity region. The two maps in Figure 13 show many geological faults
and thermal springs in southern Sardinia. In an area overlapping with the super-longevity region
there are many geochemically active faults running through or adjacent to late Mesozoic\Eocene
limestone plates including the Tirso River fault north of Nuoro. Villagrande is 50km south
southeast of Nuoro at the intersection of a fault and silica rich fossilized diatomic late
Mesozoic\Eocene limestone (see Figure 13 )^34.


Some thermal springs and rivers near Tirso Fault and the City of Nuoro were analyzed for OSA
from 1997- 20109 -^11. Results of this analysis are in Table 11. Of the 23 thermal springs analyzed
all but three had OSA greater than 48ppm^11. In one of the springs with low OSA the aluminum
level was 650ppb but in the rest of the springs, aluminum ranged from 6 to 40ppb with an
average of 15ppb^11. From this data it is likely that those people who were born during the period
1880 to 1900 in the mountains of East-Central Sardinia, including Villagrande, were exposed to
high levels of OSA and low levels of aluminum from their conception to middle age assuming
they drank water from thermal springs.

The two rivers tested, Tirso and Mannu, both had medium levels of aluminum, 69 and 41ppb
respectively^11. The level of total dissolved solids (TDS) in the rivers and springs is considered
low^8. The TDS in rivers was approximately half that of the thermal springs (i.e., 250 ppm versus
500 ppm)^11. This indicates the water from thermal springs that flows into the rivers is probably
diluted with water from karst springs and surface runoff.

Villagrande Drinking Water History - The extreme longevity index (ELI) of the Villagrande
super-longevity region indicates that newborns born from 1880 to 1900 in this region were twice
as likely to reach 100 as being born anywhere else in Sardinia during that time period^120. In


1880 to 19 5 0 the artificial lakes were not yet built and water in the Southern Barbagia region was
primarily supplied from local thermal springs. For instance, the dam creating Lago Bau Muggens
near Villagrande was not built until 1949.

Because of the dryness of the region around Villagrade it is likely that the 14 villages in this
super-longevity region were built close to sources of pure drinking water uncontaminated with
surface water runoff, such as thermal springs. From the data in Table 11 it is likely that these
thermal springs contained very high levels of OSA (i.e., 44 to 64ppm) and low levels of
aluminum (i.e., averaging 15ppb).

#### Nuragic Wells

The Nuragic civilization lived in the mountains of Sardinia from Aegean Bronze Age ( 18 th
century BC) to the 2 nd century AD. These people were dedicated to the “cult of water” and built
holy wells to both protect and access the spring-fed water supplies in these regions. Examples are
the Su Tempiesu and the Noddule holy wells in the Province of Nuoro. The architecture of these
Nuragic holy wells consists of a circular room with a small hole in the summit and monumental
staircase connecting the entrance to a subterranean room.

The main role of these structures was to allow for the protection and collection of water from
thermal springs.


Italian Drinking Water **–** I frequently visited Italy in the early 19 70’s on business and was
amazed at the amount of bottled water being consumed as it was almost unheard of in the U.S.A.
at that time. In addition, there was a complete list of all minerals in the water, including silica, on
the bottle’s label. I remember that the information on the label was an important part of meal-
time conversation. The trend in Italian bottled water usage has risen approximately 10 - fold from
1970 to 2000^8 , as shown in Figure 15. This is the same time period over which survival-to- 90
rates were measured in the longevity regions and their parent countries as indicated in Table 3.

Over 400 brands of water bottled and sold currently in Italy were tested for OSA content. The
median concentration was 17ppm with half the brands less than 17ppm and half the brands
higher than 17ppm of OSA^8. The total range of OSA was 1 to 220ppm OSA. There are no
published OSA levels for tap water in Italy. However, since these 400 brands of mineral water
are basically the same as regional tap water, this bottled water likely contains the same levels of
OSA as tap waters in Italy.

Conclusion of Sardinian and Villagrandian Longevity Regions - The drinking water in both
the Sardinia longevity region and Villagrande super-longevity region contains significantly
higher levels of OSA than do average mainland Italian bottled and non-bottled drinking waters.
The Villagrande super-longevity region is unique because it geographically coincides^2 with an


underlying layer of silica rich fossilized diatomic late Mesozoic\Eocene limestone that is
intersected with numerous faults (see Figures 1 2 and 13 )9,3^4. This makes it likely that from 1880
to 19 49 the Villagrande drinking water was high in OSA (51ppm avg.) and low in aluminum
(15ppb avg.). During this period of time the future centenarians who were born between 198 0
and 2000 had been conceived and grew into adulthood.

The mobility of the people of Villagrande is very low. Of the 1,957 people born in Villagrande
from 1876 to 1912 only 10% died outside of Villagrande^121. This translates into a lifetime spent
drinking water high in OSA and low in aluminum for 90% of the residents of Villagrande. This
was true at least until the reservoir called Lago Bau Muggens was constructed in 1949. This sets
the people of Villagrande apart from Okinawans born during the same period who did not have
high OSA water until 1933 with an interruption from 1944 to 1951. This means Okinawans did
not have high OSA water until middle age. Could this account for why there is a 5 to 1 female to
male ratio of centenarians in Okinawan versus a 1 to1 ratio of centenarians in Villagrande?

Autism may provide a clue to answer this question. The female to male ratio of children with
autism has been generally found to be 1 to 4 indicting boys are more likely than girls to have
autism^128. Approximately 50% of the children with autism, mostly boys, have increased
intestinal permeability that is not seen in children without autism^129. Aluminum has been found
at much higher levels than normal in the hair and brains of children with autism^130 -^132. From
these observations aluminum may be a causal factor of autism and boys likely absorb in general
more aluminum than girls^1.

If boys absorb more aluminum than girls, then drinking water with high levels of OSA may
benefit boys more than girls. Since chronic aluminum toxicity has been linked to heart disease,
the advantage for boys in drinking OSA rich water may extend to a greater decrease in male
versus female heart disease in midlife. Therefore, OSA in drinking water could benefit the
longevity of boys more than girls and could account for Villagrande’s unique 1 to 1 female to

### male ratio of centenarians not seen in the Okinawan longevity region.


### Ikaria, Greece

Ikaria is a small mountainous island in the Aegean Sea that is traversed by the Aetheras
Mountain range with a peak elevation of 1,037 meters (3,400 feet). It is believed to be named
after Icarus who flew too close to the sun and melted his wax wings falling into the ocean near
Ikaria. Although Icarus is not an icon of longevity, the approximately 8, 3 00 residents of Ikaria
are almost free of dementia and some chronic diseases and on average live longer than people on
the mainland of Greece. A number of health springs on Ikaria were first observed and described
as having curative powers by Herodotous (484-425 BC)^133. The current residents of Ikaria
primarily live in the plains near the coast where these thermal springs are located.

Ikaria Centenarian Validation **–** In Ikaria census data and age-at-death statistics were obtained
from Greece. For the very old no birth records could be found. Therefore, age validation could
only be done by exhaustive interviews with all those 90 and above^134. This was primarily
performed on the north side of the island. The percentage of people over age 90 living on Ikaria
was much higher than the percentage of people over 90 in the mainland Italian population^133.
The average age at death from natural causes on Ikaria is nearly 10 years greater than in
Greece^135. In addition, Ikarians have approximately 20% lower rates of cancer, 50% lower rates
of heart disease, 25% less dementia, and less depression^137.

Ikaria Epidemiology Study - From June to October of 2009 the Ikaria Epidemiology Study
took place in Ikaria. This study was organized by Christina Chrysohoou and Demosthenes B.
Panagiotakos of the Harokopio University and C. I. Stefanadis of the Department of Cardiology
of Athens Medical School. This was the first academic study of dietary and lifestyle factors on
Ikaria that might account for the islander’s longevity. The study involved first surveying 1,470
Ikarians and testing 343 men and 330 women all over age 65 with 79 of them over age 90.
Everyone in the study was a permanent resident of the island. In addition to socio-demographic,
lifestyle, physical activity, and dietary characteristics, cardiovascular risk factors were evaluated
including: hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity, and biochemical
parameters relating to cardiovascular risk^133 ,1^35.


Ikarian Sociodemographic and Lifestyle Statistics **–** As part of the Ikaria Epidemiology Study
a group of Ikarians over the age of 80 were interviewed with respect to their behaviors and
lifestyles (89 males and 98 females)^133. The study revealed the following four modifiable
lifestyle factors were linked to the “secrets” of longevity on Ikaria:

- Smoking Cessation **–** Only 17% of men and 7% of women currently smoked while 82%
    of men and 25% of women were former smokers
- Daily Moderate Physical Activity - 89% of men and 70% of women performed
    moderate to high daily physical activity and only 0.8% of men and 0.3% of women
    owned a car
- Avoiding Lack of Sleep **–** Mid-day naps supplemented a good night’s sleep
- Moderate Alcohol Consumption **–** Daily wine consumption was on average 6oz. for
    men and 4oz. for women.

These causes of human longevity are all recommended for good physical and mental health^1. But
are they sufficiently unique to set Ikaria apart from Greece? Based upon the data presented so
far in this book there is an additional lifestyle factor that must be considered important for
longevity:

- Drinking OSA Rich Water

Ikaria Drinking Water **–** In the memories of some elderly Ikarians living in the villages of
Agios Kirikos (population 3,500) there was “Immortal Water” sold by a wandering water seller
with his donkey loaded with water pitchers. This “Immortal Water” came from a famous local
spring called “Athanatou Nero” that was hidden amidst large granite rocks. The water is still
very tasty and is rumored to have therapeutic values. There are springs like this throughout Ikaria
and as it turns out they may be an important factor accounting for Ikarian longevity.

Along the southeastern coast of Ikaria there are two types of thermal springs: cool water thermal
springs and hot water thermal springs (see Table 10). In the region of the villages of Agios
Kirikos, Chrisostomos, Plagia, and Petropoulan six cool water thermal springs were tested for
OSA and their waters were found to contain on average 35ppm with a range of 18 to 58ppm^7. In


the region north of Agios Kirikos nine hot water thermal springs were tested and found to
contain too much chloride to be potable. In spite of this they did contain on average 34ppm of
OSA with a range of 22 to 51ppm^7. The source of the chloride in the hot thermal springs is likely
due to sea water intrusion^7. The cool springs contain mineral water diluted with rainwater and the
hot springs contain mineral water diluted with seawater^7. This data is summarized in Table 12
and the locations of the thermal springs are indicted on the map in Figure 16.

The springs of Ikaria have the same amount of OSA independent of their widely different
chloride level and conductivities. This is likely due to the springs of Ikaria arising from similar
geology as shown in Figure 16. Ikaria is known for its numerous thermal springs that are
classified as some of the most radioactive springs in the world^7. The radioactivity is due to
radium in the water acquired from radioactive minerals in the rocks that come in contact with the
water.


Ikarian Geology **–** The bulk of the population of Ikaria live in the northeast half of the island.
Underlying this portion of the island are two geological formations: Ikaria Unit, principally
Paleozoic gneiss, and Messaria Unit, principally interleaved schist and marble. The Paleozoic
gneiss has a layered structure and could be of either igneous or sedimentary origin. If this gneiss
is of sedimentary origin, then it might be rich in silica and made of radiolarian fossils that
evolved and dominated the world’s oceans in the Paleozoic Era. The Messaria marble probably
contains very little silica. However, Messaria schist is likely finely interleaved with quartz and/or
feldspar both of which are rich in silica.

Grecian Drinking Water **–** In Greece 87% of the potential fresh water is from surface water,
such as rivers and reservoirs, and 13% is from ground water, such as wells and springs^137 ,^138.
Water usage in Greece is divided as follows^138 ,^139 :

- 86% - Agriculture – Irrigation
- 10% - Domestic – Drinking Water
- 4% - Industrial

The drinking water of Greece has been methodically tested for nutrients and environmental
contaminates but not for silica^138 -^140. Also, some of the rivers of Greece have been tested for
nitrate and phosphate but not for silica^141. This has left researchers to derive silica levels
indirectly from environmental factors such as river water temperature. Rivers of the world and
those that drain into the Mediterranean with the usual temperature of 12- 20 oC have on average
13ppm of OSA within a range of 6 to 20ppm^142.

In order to guarantee drinking water delivery from wet season to dry season, river water flowing
into the Mediterranean has been increasingly dammed and stored in reservoirs behind the dams.
Since 1965 dams have been built in Greece that have increased the volume of fresh water
retention by more than 10 square kilometers (see Figure 17 )^142 ,1^43. The longer water is retained
in a reservoir the more silica is lost to complexation with sediments or polymerization by
cyanobacteria catalyzed by ferrihydrite20,^142. The net effect is more water retention means less
OSA in drinking water taken from reservoirs and rivers downstream from reservoirs.


There is an area in Eastern Central Greece called Northern Evia that does have nine wells with
potable high OSA water (64 to 100ppm) that is used as drinking water by local villages^144. These
villages have populations too small for any major impact on average Greek health but they might
be another undiscovered longevity region. This high OSA water comes from cool (10.6 to
21.5oC) gravity springs not considered to be thermal springs^144. The source of the silica may be
rock layers of uplifted seafloor (ophiolites) that contain mudstones rich in radiolarian fossils^145.

Conclusion of Ikaria Longevity Region - In general the drinking water of Ikaria is more silica
rich than are the drinking waters of Greece. By inference this gives Ikarians an advantage as their
aluminum excretion by urination and perspiration is facilitated by OSA. Additional advantages
are:

- Smoking cessation – tobacco contains aluminum and smoking adds aluminum to the
    brain
- Moderate physical activity – by not owning cars, Ikarians exercise and perspire resulting
    in OSA facilitating the excretion of aluminum in perspiration

These advantages are causal factors for approximately 20% lower rates of cancer, 50% lower
rates of heart disease, 25% less dementia in Ikaria^135. Because rates of these diseases are lower,
Ikarians live 10 years longer than people living in Greece^135.


### Nicoya Peninsula, Costa Rica

In Northwestern Costa Rica the city of Liberia on the Pan-American Highway is the gateway to a
beautiful peninsula that is bordered by the Pacific Ocean on the west and the Gulf of Nicoya on
the east. The Nicoya Peninsula is currently known as a destination for fine beaches and fantastic
surfing.

Henri Pittier, a Swiss geographer and botanist, moved to Costa Rica in 1887. Pittier was a
skilled observer of both plants and humans. After visiting the Nicoya Peninsula, he observed that
“in no other place are people blessed with such long lives”^146. Recently Nicoya’s longevity has
been examined in a population-based sample of elderly Costa Ricans^147. Pittier’s observation
was confirmed as Nicoya has a significantly lower death rate ratio compared to the rest of Costa
Rica (see Table 4). Since Pittier’s observation was made over a century ago, Nicoya’s longevity
was prevalent even at the time when present day centenarians were born.

This is the first longevity region discussed that is not an island. However, being a peninsula, it is
somewhat geographically isolated. The Nicoya longevity region is within the Province of
Guanacaste and has a population of 161,000 according to the 2011 census^146. Most of the
Nicoya population is located inland between 100 to 500 meters above sea level and 95% of the
population is in three cantons living primarily in the canton’s capital city:

The cantons listed in Table 1 3 are in what is locally called the Guanacaste lowlands. The
Tempisque River basin is primarily in the Carillo canton near Filadelfia. Currently the
Tempisque River and underground aquifers in the Guanacaste lowlands are insufficient to supply
the needed surface and ground water to these cantons. A construction project is beginning in
2018 with the goal of diverting water for human consumption and irrigation from the Piedras


River Reservoir^148. The first phase of this project is scheduled for completion in 20 2 3. In general
this area is mixed forest and agriculture with ground and surface water used for drinking water
and crop irrigation.

Nicoya Centenarian Validation **–** The age validation of the oldest of the old and the assessment
of population longevity were based on public voting lists and the birth registry. This registry
includes birth dates, naturalizations, and deaths of all Costa Ricans who contacted the civil
registration system since its computerization in 1970^149. Each person was given a unique number
at birth or at naturalization that appears on their identification card. The age of the oldest of the
old was confirmed with self-reported information at an interview. Data quality and the higher
level of longevity on Nicoya compared with the rest of Costa Rico has been confirmed and
published^146.

Nicoya Study Results - Nicoyan males have a much greater survival rate to age 90 than do
Costa Rican males (see Table 4). This Nicoyan advantage does not extend fully to Nicoyan
females who have only a slightly greater survival rate to age 90 than do Costa Rican females (see
Table 4). Looking at survival to age 100, a 60-year-old Nicoyan male has a 7 times higher
probability of becoming a centenarian than does a 60-year-old Japanese male. The Nicoyan male
has a 2.2-year greater life expectancy than does the Japanese male.

The Nicoyan advantage is a death rate ratio of 0.82 versus Costa Rica’s 1.0 and is lower (i.e.,
0.77) for those that were born and remained in Nicoya (see Table 14)^146. The Nicoyan advantage
does not occur in females, is independent of socio-economic conditions, disappears in out-
migrants (those born in Nicoya and at the time of the study living elsewhere), and comes
primarily from lower male cardiovascular mortality^146. Males are also leaner, taller, and suffer
fewer disabilities^146. The higher mortality in out-migrants points to an environmental factor
rather than a genetic factor being the cause of the Nicoyan advantage.^


Biomarkers of Longevity in Elderly Nicoyans **–** Biomarkers for about 600 elderly Nicoyans
and 4,500 elderly Costa Ricans were analyzed to better understand the Nicoyan advantage146,147.
The biomarkers found to be significantly different, where Nicoyans are either negatively (i.e.,
lower) or positively (i.e., higher) than Costa Ricans, are listed in Table 1 5. Where not indicated
the biomarkers were seen in both males and females. Unlike in Okinawa, plasma level of
homocysteine was not tested as part of this biomarker survey.

Aluminum is a likely causal factor of Alzheimer’s disease that results in daily living disability
(a.k.a. ALD)^1. OSA also lowers the risk of Alzheimer’s disease and prevents ADL disability^1.
Aluminum inhibits the utilization of both glucose and stored fat for energy^1. This results in
higher levels of triglycerides and glycated hemoglobin as well as greater body mass index (a.k.a.
BMI) and waist circumference. Both high aluminum levels and triglycerides are causal factors of
cardiovascular disease^1. Drinking silica water (i.e., OSA) facilitates the excretion of aluminum
resulting in lower levels of fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin, and triglycerides in the blood
and less BMI, waist circumference, and cardiovascular disease^1. Information on how aluminum
impacts telomere length is described in “Telomere Length as a Biomarker for Longevity” (see
Chapter 5 ).

Nicoya Drinking Water **–** The Nicoya peninsula is unique as it sets atop the largest area of
ophiolites in Costa Rica as shown in Figure 18150. Ophiolites are rocks from ancient uplifted sea
floor sediment laid down approximately 200 to 40 million years ago. The ophiolite named the
Nicoya Complex underling the entire peninsula is formed exclusively of silica-rich intraplate
igneous rocks associated with radiolarities^151. Within the Nicoya Complex is a 50-meter-thick


layer called the Punta Conchal Formation. This layer consists of rhythmically thin-stratified
radiolarian cherts^152. Under the central and southern parts of the Nicoya Peninsula there are
numerous silica-saturated volcanic tufts and debris with preserved radiolarian fossils^153. The
Nicoya Complex is capped with sandstone that also contains radiolarian skeletons fossilized in
radiolarian cherts^151. It is not surprising with this geology that the surface waters, such as the
Tempisque River, and ground waters of Nicoya have high levels of OSA.

The water quality of the Tempisque River has been periodically monitored in both dry and rainy
seasons at Guinea in 1980 to 1981 and at Guardia from 1987 to 1991. OSA was one of the
factors analyzed and the results are in Table 1 66.

The high levels of OSA in the Tempisque River even in the rainy season are similar to levels
seen in ground waters of Sardinia and Ikaria.


Costa Rican Drinking Water - Costa Rica is a country with outstanding male and female
longevity. Male survivability in Costa Rica is second only to the Villagrande super-longevity
region and female survivability in Costa Rica is second only to the Okinawa longevity region
(see Table 4 ). The age-adjusted rate of mortality from cardiovascular disease (CVD), at ages 85
and older, is 20% lower in Costa Rica than the United States^149. Like Okinawa and Ikaria, Costa
Rica also has a low rate of CVD. OSA in drinking water is a likely causal factor in Costa Rica’s
country-wide longevity.

There are two sources of silica rich substrata in Costa Rica: ophiolites and silicic volcanic ash-
flow sheets, such as Tiribi Tuff and the Guanacaste ash-flow tuffs. The areas of these types of
deposits are shown in Figure 18150. The Tiribi Tuff underlies most of the Valle Central of Costa
Rica, currently the most densely populated area in the country with approximately 2.4 million
inhabitants (see Figure 19 ). The Tiribi Tuff contains 59 to 65% silicon dioxide (SiO 2 ) by
weight^150. Water samples from two streams, the Tizate and Quebrada La Pita, in the area of the
Tiribi Tuff were sampled and analyzed at 10 locations in 1998 and found to contain 2 7.5 to 45.4
ppm of OSA^154. Drinking water that flows through these deposits is enriched in OSA and the
population exposed to this drinking water will accrue health and longevity benefits.


The city of San Vito and its northern neighboring area circled in Figure 19 , like Nicoya, has a
population living near silica rich ophiolite deposits. The San Vito area has a population of only
12,000 and in the period from 1990 to 2011 those 70 and older had a very low mortality rate of
0.66 versus 0.82 for Nicoya and 1.0 for Costa Rica^146. San Vito is at the south end of the Coto
Brus Valley at an altitude of 996 meters (3,268 feet) on a high plateau with irregular topography.
The Java River flows through the outskirts of San Vito and has been the source of drinking water
for the city for many years^155. The city is located near ophiolite deposits in Southern Costa Rica
(see Figure 18 ) that likely enrich the Java River with OSA.

Conclusion of Nicoya and San Vito Longevity Regions - The Nicoya Peninsula and the area
around San Vito are longevity regions in Costa Rica. Both of these longevity regions sit atop or
near silica rich ophiolite deposits with the potential of enriching surface and ground water with
OSA. It is incredible that there are longevity regions in Costa Rica considering the extreme
longevity of Costa Ricans who are also exposed to OSA in their drinking water due to volcanic
ash-flow under the Valle Central, where the bulk of the population of Costa Rica resides. The
only difference between Costa Rica and its longevity regions may be the level of OSA in the
drinking water. Limited water analysis data indicates higher levels of OSA in Nicoyan surface
water than in Costa Rican surface water.

The increased longevity in Costa Rica and its longevity regions is primarily due to a low level of
male cardiovascular disease (CVD). We have already seen that OSA may be responsible for low
CVD in Okinawa and Ikaria. Like Villagrande, being born and remaining in Nicoya is linked to
male longevity. People who migrate out of Nicoya have higher mortality than those that remain
in Nicoya suggesting that the Nicoyan advantage is environmental and not genetic.


### Loma Linda, California, USA

In the 18 6 0’s the Seventh-day Adventist church was founded in a sunny pocket of California
now called Loma Linda or “beautiful hill” in Spanish. Under the dominant influence of a
cofounder, Ellen G. White (1827-1915), the denomination became focused on both missionary
and medical work. Church members continue to view health as central to their faith and this view
is believed to be why they live longer than non-church members. Between 2000 and 2010 Loma
Linda’s population grew by 25% to 23,260. Currently Loma Linda is a community of
approximately 9,000 Adventists representing about 40% of Loma Linda’s population^156. The
community of approximately 35,000 Adventists in California, including those in Loma Linda, is
a longevity region when its longevity is viewed in comparison with the Californian population^157.

Loma Linda Centenarian Validation **–** The U.S.A. census data is not necessarily a reliable
source of information. Past U.S.A. censuses have exaggerated the number of American
centenarians. The 1980 census, for example, listed approximately double what demographers
believe to be the actual prevalence rates of centenarians due to errors, such as either elderly
people misreporting their age or 4-year-olds reported as 104 because their birth years were
marked wrongly^158 ,^159. Therefore, in populations that claim more centenarians than normal for
the area, careful scrutiny of birth and death records and any other age-related documents is
necessary to support longevity claims. This type of centenarian validation in Loma Linda has not
been reported. But what has been studied is the average longevity of California Seventh-day
Adventists.

Californian Seventh-day Adventist Study **–** Gary Fraser is a Professor of Cardiology at the
University of Loma Linda with an interest in the longevity of Seventh-day Adventists. Professor
Fraser led a study of 34,192 Californian Seventh-day Adventists from 197 5 to 1988^160 ,1^61. In
order to qualify for the study participants had to be white, non-Hispanic, at least 30 years old,
and living in a California Adventist household. Sixty percent of those who qualified completed
an extensive lifestyle questionnaire regarding their medical history, diet, physical activity,
smoking habit, and a few psychosocial variables. In order to evaluate possible errors arising from
the optical mark scanner and check for reliability of response 165 households (248 persons) were
visited for a face-to-face interview. Subjects were contacted by mail every year to report any


hospitalizations. Field staff visited hospitals and photocopied the subject’s medical records that
provided evidence of cardiovascular events or cancer. Mortality for all subjects was ascertained
by matching to state death tapes and the National Death Index.

The study concluded that California Adventists, including those living in Loma Linda, have a
higher life expectancy at the age of 30 than do other white Californians. Adventist’s life
expectancy was 7. 3 years longer for men and 4.4 years longer for women than for other white
California men and women^161. A key to unlocking the secret of why Adventists live longer goes
back to the founding tenants of their religion. A fundamental belief requires all members to
abstain from any form of alcohol and tobacco. Possibly even more importantly, cofounder Ellen
G. White prescribed drinking six to eight glasses of water a day. Water has always been believed
to have the ability to flush toxins from the body, make the blood flow more freely, and prevent
clotting. In addition, drinking six to eight glasses of water a day likely pushes both sugar
sweetened and alcoholic beverages out of the diet.

Analysis of the data from the Californian Adventist study including a six-year follow-up
revealed that among the 8,280 males and 12,017 females, who were without heart disease,
stroke, and diabetes in 1976, there had been 246 fatal coronary heart disease events. Drinking
five or more glasses of water a day was associated with a 54 % less risk for men and a 41 % less
risk for women of fatal coronary heart disease compared with Adventists who drank only two
glasses or less of water a day^160. Even more dramatically, a high versus low intake of fluids other
than water increased the risk to 146% in men and 247% in women^162. A likely explanation for
these results is that by adhering to Adventist’s teachings both aluminum and ethanol in fluids
other than water are prevented from inhibiting the detoxification of homocysteine that is a causal
factor of atherosclerosis and heart disease^1 :

- Drinking more water means more OSA is consumed resulting in both more aluminum
    being excreted and more homocysteine being detoxified, lowering the risk of
    atherosclerosis and heart disease^1.
- Avoiding alcoholic beverages keeps plasma homocysteine at 8.5 to 9μM/L, decreasing
    the risk of atherosclerosis and heart disease^163.


Approximately 30% of those that participated in the Adventist study were vegetarians who ate
meat less frequently than once a month and 23% ate nuts at least 5 times a week. The data from
the Adventists study is compared with 1990 statistics on Japan and the U.S.A. in Table 1 7161 ,1^64.

Californian Adventists who are vegetarians have the longest life expectancy from birth when
compared with all Californian Adventists and both Japan and the U.S.A. as shown in Table 1 7.
Likely reasons for this are:

- Some vegetables are rich in OSA as they sequester OSA for aluminum toxicity
    protection^1
- High vegetable protein diet with high levels of folic acid decreases homocysteine^165

The difference between vegetarian and non-vegetarian Adventists extends to the risk of colon,
prostate, and breast cancer as shown in Table 1 8166. This data for prostate and breast cancer
mirrors the lower rates of these cancers in Okinawa versus mainland Japan (see Table 5 ).

Breast, prostate, and colon cancers have been linked to mutation in germ cells (i.e., cells when
fully developed become sperm and ovum) of the BRCA1 gene that prevent DNA repair by the
BRCA1 protein^111. BRCA1 mutations are linked to 5 - fold increased risk of colorectal cancers in
women younger than 50 years of age^167. Breast cancer has also been linked to decreased


expression of the BRCA1gene^110. Aluminum is a likely causal factor of these three cancers
because it inhibits the expression of the BRCA1 gene preventing DNA repair by the BRCA1
protein^110. The lower rates of these cancers shown in Table 1 8 are likely due to both drinking
more water containing OSA and eating more vegetables containing OSA. Some vegetables are
good sources of OSA that may prevent the development of breast, prostate, and colon cancer by
facilitating excretion of aluminum1,1^65. For information on OSA in vegetables see Chapter 4.

Approximately 40% of those that participated in the Adventist Health Study exercise vigorously
for at least 15 minutes 3 times a week. Being more physically active in middle age extends life
an extra 2.5 years^168. Higher physical activity throughout life is estimated to extend life by 2.1
years^169. Women who participated in the Adventist Health Study and exercised only infrequently
had a 27% higher lifetime risk of breast cancer and an age of diagnosis of breast cancer 6 years
younger on average than women who exercised frequently^170. There are several reasons for this
as described in my book Prevent Alzheimer’s, Autism, and Stroke^1 but possibly the most
important reason is that OSA in perspiration facilitates the excretion of aluminum in sweat (see
Table 3 )^74 ,^75.

Loma Linda Drinking Water - Loma Linda gets its drinking water from three Mountain View
Wells (3,5,6) and four Richardson Wells (3,4,5,6) that pump water out of the Bunker Hill Basin
Aquifer. This aquifer extends from the San Bernardino Mountain Range to the south hills of
Loma Linda. The water that replenishes the aquifer comes from rainfall and snowmelt from the
San Bernardino Mountains. The wells are located in North Loma Linda. Loma Linda also uses
supplemental water as needed from the City of San Bernardino Municipal Water Department^171.

The California Seventh-day Adventist Study was performed between 1975 and 1988 with a six-
year follow-up in 1994. Just after the study and during the follow-up period in 1989 an appraisal
of ground water quality in the Bunker Hill Basin was performed by the U.S. Geological Survey
in cooperation with the San Bernardino Valley Municipal Water District^5. Seven wells in North
Loma Linda were tested for organics and inorganics including silica. The locations and number
of the wells tested are indicated in Figure 20.


There are at least two aquifers, an upper and lower, under the area of the seven wells in North
Loma Linda. These layers reach maximum depth and thickness in an underground canon along
the Loma Linda Fault that runs on a straight line from the northwest to the southeast directly
under well 23K2. Between half a mile southwest to two miles northeast of the Loma Linda Fault
the upper aquifer is approximately 300 feet thick and the lower aquifer is approximately 600 feet
thick. All seven of the wells tested are located above this underground canon^5.

The upper aquifer has water with slightly higher levels of OSA at 37ppm on average than the
lower aquifer with 30ppm on average. Not surprisingly, the well that takes water from both
aquifers is in the middle of the OSA range at 33.6ppm^5. This data is summarized in Table 1 9
with reference to specific wells.

For those of Loma Linda who follow the Adventists teachings and daily drink 6 to 8 glasses of
water, they are effectively consuming the equivalent amount of OSA as someone who drinks 3 to


4 glasses of silica water containing 65ppm of OSA. In 2015 the amount of aluminum in Loma
Linda’s drinking water was 7.5ppb. Adventists in Loma Linda consume drinking water that is
high in silica and low in aluminum and this may well be a causal factor for their longevity.

U.S.A. Drinking Water - In drinking water surveys of the large cities in the U.S.A., OSA was
reported to vary from 0 to 115ppm with 11ppm as the median^3. Raw waters in the U.S.A. may
contain 1 to 48ppm of OSA^3. Aluminum levels in U.S.A. drinking water are summarized in
Table 203. In the U.S.A. alum (a.k.a. aluminum sulfate) is the most common surface water
treatment used. As indicted in Table 20 over half the alum treated drinking water in the U.S.A.
contains over 100 ppb of aluminum. In the seven largest epidemiology studies to date,
aluminum over 100 ppb has been linked to an elevated risk of Alzheimer’s disease^1.

In order to lower aluminum in drinking water, treating with an iron coagulant versus an
aluminum coagulant would be preferred as shown in Table 203. Treating with iron does remove
some silica from the water^3. Most U.S.A. drinking waters need more silica added for the health
of the population. Therefore, after treating surface water with iron, the water should be fortified
with added dissolvable silica. All ground water that is low in silica should also be fortified.

Conclusion of Loma Linda Longevity Region - Loma Linda, like Okinawa, has shown us that
reducing the body-burden of aluminum by drinking silica water can lower the risk of
cardiovascular disease and cancer and increase longevity. The Adventists of California have
demonstrated that drinking more water (greater than 5 glasses a day) does lower the risk of
cardiovascular disease. The Adventists of Loma Linda who follow the teachings of the Ellen G.


White and drink 6 to 8 glasses of water a day, drink the equivalent of 3 to 4 glasses of 65ppm of
OSA enriched water containing 15 ppb of aluminum. This is in sharp contrast with the average
drinking water in the U.S.A. with median levels of 11ppm OSA and 31ppb aluminum in ground
water and 112ppb aluminum in treated surface water.

Also, the Adventist Health Study found that frequent exercise for at least 15 minutes 3 times a
week can decrease both the risk of breast cancer and the age of diagnosis of breast cancer by 6
years. This translates to a life extension of 2.1 to 2.5 years and is likely due to OSA in
perspiration facilitating the removal of aluminum from the body during exercise.

Adventists who are vegetarians have an increased amount of dietary OSA due to high levels of
OSA in vegetables. Adventists who are gardeners in Loma Linda are enriching their vegetables
with OSA due to irrigation with OSA rich tap water. This translates to a lower risk of
cardiovascular disease and cancer resulting in a 1.7 to 2.5-year life extension.


### West Hechi, China

Hechi is a prefecture located in the north of the Guangxi region of China (see Figure 21). The
Guangxi region is in southern China on the border with Viet Nam. In western Hechi there are
three adjacent counties with much higher centenarian prevalences and longevity indexes than
three adjacent counties to the east in central Hechi. The longevity counties are: Bama Yao,
Fengshan, and Donglan with Bama Yao being a super longevity region having the highest
longevity index. The non-longevity counties are: Huanjiang, Jinchengjiang, and Nandan. The
Duyang Mountains separate the longevity counties from the non-longevity counties (see Figure
21).

Bama Yao Longevity Region Verification **–** In 1992 Yang used data from the 1990 census and
from a questionnaire survey conducted in Bama Yao to analyze the population age 80 and
over^462. In May to June of 1994 three Chinese demographers evaluated the quality of Yang’s
survey data by interviewing 6 7 out of 73 people over age 100 in Bama Yao^463. Age records were
available from birth registers and generation rankings. They found that only 3 centenarians still
had spouses and 42 were women and 25 were men. The people of Bama Yao are comprised of
13 ethnic groups with only 17.4% being Yao. The demographers found Yang’s survey data to be
reliable.

Air Quality in Bama Yao - The centenarian prevalence and the longevity index of 31 regions in
China, including Guangxi, were evaluated in 2016 with respect to air quality parameters^464.
Sulfur dioxide and particulates in the air, 10nm or smaller, were negatively correlated with
centenarian prevalence and the longevity index, respectively. The three longevity counties and
three non-longevity counties in Guangxi, including Bama Yao, are located in remote
mountainous areas (see Figure 21) and therefore their air quality is well above average. Because
all six counties have the same air quality, it is not possible that air quality is a factor in the
observed longevity in Bama Yao.


Figure 21 **–** Location of Hechi and its sampling sites (c) in Gurangxi (b), China (a)^461


Natural and Socioeconomic Factors in Bama Yao **–** Natural factors, such as temperature and
altitude, and socioeconomic factors, such as gross domestic product (a.k.a. GDP) , economic
status, education, local infrastructure, and health care facilities, were evaluated spatially and
geographically with respect to 7 longevity indicators, including centenarian prevalence and
longevity index, in 109 selected counties and districts in Guangxi^465. The results indicated only a
weak association with longevity and natural factors, such as temperature and altitude, and
socioeconomic factors, such as GDP per capita. However, the average GDP in Hechi was
comparatively lower than other regions in Guangxi^461. All the longevity and non-longevity
counties in West Hechi have similar topography and temperatures. Therefore, there is no
natural of socioeconomic factor that stands out as being a contributor to the longevity
observed in Bama Yao.

Environmental Factors in Bama Yao **–** Trace elements in the soil and drinking water of Hechi
were evaluated temporally and spatially with respect to centenarian prevalence and longevity
index from 1982 to 2010^461. The trace elements measured in the drinking water sampled from 40
locations were: Pb, Zn, Cd, SO 42 - , Mn, H 2 SiO 3 , Ca, Fe, Na, Mg, Li, Mo, and Se. The trace
elements measured in soil were: Sr, K, Mo, Fe, Co, Zn, Cu. The only trace element in soil and
drinking water that showed a significant (0.01 level) positive correlation with both
centenarian prevalence and longevity index is H 2 SiO 3. This trace element forms a hydrate
in water called OSA (H 4 SiO 4 ). For details see Table 4 at the beginning of this chapter.

The following paragraph is taken from the paper linking OSA to longevity in the three longevity
counties, including Bama Yao^461 : “As many centenarians live in rocky areas^466 , most of the
members of the longevity population in Hechi use the underground water source as their primary
water supply. These areas do not have much surface water but do have abundant quantities of
underground water from underground caverns. For example, in 1982, 1990, and 2000,
approximately 75% of the centenarians in Bama County lived in rocky and semi-rocky areas and
used underground water as their main water source, and approximately 30% of the underground
water areas have sustained approximately 70% of the centenarians in Bama over decades^467. It
can be inferred that the distinctive tectonic settings of Hechi might have long-term impacts on
longevity in this region“.


Distinctive Tectonic Setting of West Hechi, China

The tectonic setting of western Guangxi has been studied^468. The Duyang Mountains that
separate the longevity from the non-longevity counties in Hechi lie along a geological rift. Rifts
occur linearly along the central axis of most mid-ocean ridges where two tectonic plates are
diverging and literally pulling apart the earth’s crust. The result is a long wide valley to the west
of the Duyang Mountains where the three longevity counties are located called the Danchi Rift
Trough^468. This area is distinctive because drinking water in this area is significantly higher in
OSA than the area just to the east of the Duyang Mountains^461.

Deep-water ocean sediments from the late Early Devonian to the late Permian have been uplifted
in the Danchi Rift Trough. The chert that underlies Bama Yao is from the Middle Permian
period^469. The rocks in this area are mostly chert containing greater than 7 0% silicon dioxide
(SiO 2 ) derived from non-terrigenous (i.e., marine) sediments^468. Sources of these marine
sediments can be of either biogenic or hydrothermal origin.

The source of silica in this chert is predominantly biogenic being derived from siliceous
organisms such as radiolarians, diatoms, and siliceous sponges^468. This chert is richer in SiO 2
than modern oceanic siliceous sediment and less rich in SiO 2 as compared with the nearly pure
SiO 2 in chert from terrigenous sources, such as volcanos^468. Enrichment of biogenic SiO 2 in chert
is hypothesized to occur by a process called diagenetic silicification that more than doubles the
SiO 2 in chert^470. In this process water enriched in OSA displaces calcium carbonate in chert
making biogenic SiO 2 (a.k.a. opal)^471.

Opal is a good source of OSA as it is the most soluble solid silicate in sediments^472. When water
comes in contact with different types of opal sediments at pore depths greater than 10cm the
equilibrium concentration of OSA in the water is from 9.6 to 72ppm (100 to 750mcM L-^1 )^472.
The unique conditions required for diagenetic silicification resulting in opal deposits may
account for the unique OSA rich well water found in the Danchi Rift Trough in West
Hetchi, China.


### Marion, Iowa

Driven by the increasing cost of caring for the elderly population in the U.SA., states are looking
at health initiatives led by communities and businesses. These grassroots efforts are promoted by
political leaders with the goals of increasing their state’s health ranking and saving money on
health care. An example is Iowa where on August 10th 2011 Governor Terry Bradstad challenged
fellow Iowans to make the Hawkeye State the healthiest state in the nation by 2016. In 2011
Iowa was ranked the 19th most healthy state in the union. The Governor proposed in his
Healthiest State Initiative that if Iowan’s adopted some lifestyle changes, their quality of life
could be improved while saving the state $18 billion in costs for caring for the elderly over the 5-
year period from 2011 to 2016.

One of these 10 Iowa cities selected for this initiative was Marion, where my father lived for his
entire life, except for the six years he spent in the navy during World War II. My mother lived in
their single-family home in Marion until she was 94½ the last 2½ years by herself after my father
died in 2019 at age 95. My mother and father both decided in 2014 to change the quality of their
lives by daily drinking silica rich water. This lifestyle change continued for 5 years and resulted
in my mother’s memory improving sufficiently to continue living in her home needing minimal
medical and caretaking support. My mother is an example of healthy longevity that can cut the
costs for caring for the elderly.

Marion Drinking Water - The drinking water in Marion comes from the Jordan aquafer that
underlies most of Iowa. The OSA concentration in the aquifer is reported to vary from 8 to
48 ppm ( 5 - 3 0ppm SiO 2 )^171. Unfortunately, Marion is located in the area of 13ppm OSA (8ppm
SiO 2 ) or less^173. In 2018 the measured concentration of OSA in Marion tap water was only
2ppm^174.

Conclusion of Marion, Iowa - My mom had been diagnosed with cognitive impairment in 2012
that was impacting her daily living skills. Because of this in 2012 I began researching
preventative treatments for Alzheimer’s disease. By 2014 I recommended my parents daily
drink 3 to 4 cups of Fiji water containing approximately 12 4 ppm of OSA^174 ,1^75. Fiji water is


available at the local grocery store but it was very heavy to lug home. Amazon Prime came to
the rescue with free delivery of Fiji water to my parent’s door at a price lower than the grocery
store’s price. If Marion added silica to their drinking water, the entire city would stand an
excellent chance of becoming a longevity region.

I am delighted to say that when I began my research into why my mother’s short-term memory
was failing, she mostly talked about things that happened 60 years ago. Now every time we talk,
she describes in detail things that have happened during the day and in the last few days. While
daily drinking silica rich water my mother’s cognition continued to improve as demonstrated by
two mini-mental state examinations (a.k.a. MMSE) administered by her doctor. She scored 22
out of 30 in September of 2017 and scored 24 out of 30 in September of 2018 with scores of 20
to 24 being regarded as mild cognitive impairment (a.k.a. MCI).

I primarily attribute her Alzheimer’s reversal to drinking silica rich water. In addition, she has
followed the recommendations of my first book, including frequent physical activity with some
perspiration^1. I can only hope that others will follow in my mother’s footsteps and drink silica
rich water, change their lifestyle choices, and take the several daily supplements I recommend^1.
Why wait for a promised cure when you can take action now while you still have your mental
health.


### Conclusion of Silica Water for Healthy Longevity

Loren Eiseley was correct when he said “If there is magic on this planet, it is in the water.” The
magic is called dissolved silica as OSA and it is the secret of healthy longevity. It is indeed
remarkable that a common thread has been found to exist in all six longevity regions. That
common thread is OSA enriched silica drinking water.

We must thank the demographers who identified the six longevity regions as they have given us
the chance to explore the magic and understand the secret of why the people of these regions
have extreme longevity. This exploration has opened our eyes to OSA in drinking water as a
naturally occurring safe and inexpensive preventative for common fatal diseases, such as
cardiovascular disease, cancer, and Alzheimer’s. Drinking more silica water than normal allows
some Seventh-day Adventists, who follow the teachings of the church, to double the amount of
OSA they consume. This may account for why Adventists who drank five or more glasses of
silica water a day had a 54 % less risk for men and a 41 % less risk for women of a fatal coronary
heart disease event compared with Adventists who drank only two glasses or less of silica water
a day^160.

Because OSA rich silica water both facilitates the elimination of aluminum from the body and
lowers the risk of common fatal diseases, such as cardiovascular, cancer, and Alzheimer’s, it
further implicates aluminum as a causal factor of these diseases. The finding that people who
migrate out of Nicoya do not have the extreme life expectancy of those that have spent their life
in Nicoya supports the contention that Nicoya’s longevity is due to an environmental factor, such
as OSA rich silica water, and not genetics.

Physical movement or exercise is commonly performed in all longevity regions. For instance, in
Ikaria, 89% of men and 70% of women performed moderate to high daily physical activity and
only 0.8% of men and 0.3% of women owned a car. This is typical of longevity regions since
their populations are at the low end of the economic spectrum, with the exception of Loma
Linda. Also, longevity regions are in general hilly areas requiring additional effort to move
about. Physical exercise is good for a number of reasons^1 , but possibly most importantly it
results in perspiration. Aluminum is excreted in perspiration and OSA facilitates this by
increasing the concentration of aluminum excreted in the sweat of men and women^74 ,^75. This


may account for why Seventh-day Adventist women who exercised only infrequently had a 27%
higher lifetime risk of breast cancer and an age of diagnosis of breast cancer 6 years younger on
average than Adventist women who exercised frequently^170.

There are unexpected differences between men and women centenarians in longevity regions.
For instance, in Okinawa the ratio of female to male centenarians is 5 to 1 while in Villagrande it
is 1 to 1. The Okinawan centenarians did not drink OSA rich silica water until 1933 to 1944 and
then after 1951 when their water supply was rebuilt after World War II. Those living in
Villagrande benefitted from OSA rich silica water from conception to at least 1949 when Lago
Bau Muggens was created. Therefore, OSA in drinking water from conception seems to benefit
the life expectancy of young men more than young women and could account for Villagrande’s
unique 1 to 1 female to male ratio of centenarians not seen in the Okinawan longevity region.

Evolutionarily men have evolved to not only produce more sweat by volume than women but
when drinking OSA rich silica water, men’s sweat has a higher concentration of aluminum than
women’s sweat. This evolutionary advantage for men could be the reason OSA rich silica water
benefits men more than women. This may be either in spite of or an evolutionary response to
boys absorbing more aluminum than girls.

As Benjamin Franklin pointed out in 1736 “an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure”.
States and their communities are beginning to embrace this as witnessed in Iowa where a grass
roots effort to lower health care costs by improving community health was implemented in 2013.
In the 5-year time period between 2013 and 2018 Iowa’s ranking was raised from 19th to the 13th
most healthy state in the union. In order to achieve even greater success in Iowa at least 5 0ppm
of OSA should be added to community drinking water. Only by making OSA rich silica water
available to all, will we have true-blue longevity regions.

Another common thread that exists in all longevity regions is OSA rich vegetables in the diet.
This diet has been called the Mediterranean Diet. The fact that vegetarians live longer than non-
vegetarians is not surprising, as vegetables sequester OSA for their own protection against
aluminum in the soil. Vegetables are a supplementary source of OSA in the diet as discussed in
the next chapter.


## Chapter 4 – Dietary Bioavailable Dissolved Silica

In addition to silica in drinking water being at abnormally high levels in all longevity regions,
another common factor is the above normal amount of home or locally grown vegetables
consumed in longevity regions. As described in Chapter 2 vegetables sequester silica for defense
against aluminum. Eating a vegetable with sequestered OSA involves transferring the defense
from vegetables to humans. Therefore, just like drinking OSA rich silica water, eating OSA rich
vegetables promotes longevity by lowering the risk of three common fatal diseases:

- Cancer - Vegetarians have a significantly lower risk of breast, prostate, and colon cancer
    than non-vegetarians^166.
- Dementia **–** Non-Vegetarians in California have twice the risk of having dementia as
    compared with vegetarians, except in Loma Linda^176. This exception could be explained
    simply as both non-vegetarians and vegetarians in Loma Linda get high levels of OSA
    from their drinking water and therefore both have a lower risk of dementia.
- Cardiovascular Disease **–** People who took part in the Nurse’s Health Study (75,600
    women and 38,700 men) who were in the highest quintile of fruit and vegetable intake
    had 31% lower risk of ischemic stroke and 20% lower risk of coronary heart
    disease^177 ,1^78. This translates to a 6% lower risk of stroke and a 4% lower risk of coronary
    heart disease for every daily serving of fruits or vegetables^177 ,1^78.

These are the same three diseases that are found to be lower in longevity regions of Okinawa and
Loma Linda. Also, Ikarians have approximately 20% lower rates of cancer, 50% lower rates of
heart disease, and 25% less dementia^137. In addition, the Nicoyan advantage comes primarily
from lower male cardiovascular mortality^1 36,1^49. Although OSA in longevity region drinking
water may be the primary reason for low rates of these terminal diseases, an important secondary
factor is the consumption in longevity regions of home or locally grown garden vegetables
biofortified with irrigation water containing more silica than normal.

The advantage of eating vegetables at the expense of meat works best if the vegetables are rich in
silica. In longevity regions where drinking water and irrigation water come from the same silica


rich sources, there is an enhancement of silica in vegetables by fertilization with silica water.
Irrigation of crops with silica enriched (50 to 100ppm) water has been shown to increase the
silica biofortification of leafy vegetables with an increase silica bioavailability in the edible parts
as shown in Table 21^179.

Fruits, such as apples, bananas, and grapes, can also be enriched in silica with application of
silica fertilizer^180 -^182. In the case of grapes, fertilizing with 11 2 ppm OSA resulted in 20% more
accumulation of silica in the leaves of some cultivars^182. Analysis of the leaves of these fertilized
grapes revealed 2% (20,000mg/Kg) total silica (SiO 2 ) by weight and 0.1% by (1,000mg/Kg)
weight of water soluble OSA. This is significant because grape wine and leaves are a part of the
diet in the Mediterranean longevity regions.

The beneficial silica in vegetables and fruit is in two forms: water soluble OSA and water
insoluble biosilifications of SiO 2 , such as phytoliths. OSA lowers aluminum absorption in the gut
and reverses aluminum accumulation in the body as shown in Table 164. Oligomeric (i.e.,
polymeric) silica has an affinity for aluminum in the gut that surpasses even OSA^30. For this
reason, it is not surprising that phytoliths also have an affinity for aluminum forming HAS on
their surfaces^58. The more HAS coating the surfaces of phytoliths, the less they dissolve as OSA
in water^184. When phytoliths are ingested they lower aluminum absorption in the gut and enhance
aluminum excretion. Therefore, eating vegetables and fruit provides humans with two forms of
beneficial silica: OSA for lowering accumulated aluminum in the body and both OSA and
biosilifactions of SiO 2 for decreasing aluminum absorption in the gut.


### Declining Sources of Silica in the Diet

Because of silica’s abundance in the earth’s crust most soils formerly contained sufficient silica
to allow plants grown on this soil to maximize their silica accumulation^185. However, after many
years of harvesting crops and only fertilizing with phosphorus, nitrogen, and potassium, both the
soil upon which these crops are grown and the crops themselves have become nutrient
depleted^186. The vegetables and fruits we eat today are silica deficient compared with those eaten
by our ancestors.

There are plants that accumulate silica at concentrations of over 1% by weight and accumulate
more silica than calcium^185. Eight of the 10 most produced crops of the world are silica
accumulators and all 9 of the most produced crops in the U.S.A. are silica accumulators as listed
in Table 22^187 ,^188. In the U.S.A. production of these 9 crops removes approximately 10 million
tons of silicon that is equivalent to 34 million tons of OSA from the soil each year. The OSA
removal rate from the entire U.S.A. cropland is estimated at approximately twice this level
annually^187. Without the application of silica fertilizers, the silica in the food we eat has declined
and will continue decline. For this reason, supplementing our drinking water with OSA rich
silica water makes good sense.


Worldwide two of the largest silicon accumulator crops are sugar cane and rice as shown in
Table 22. Magnesium silicate used as a fertilizer resulted in the yield of sugar cane in the Cauca
Valley of Columbia increasing by 14.6% and sugar production increased by 20%. Likewise, rice
production in the Magdalena Valley and Atlantic coastal areas of Columbia increased by 21% to
33%^189. This work shows that using silica fertilizers can financially help farmers by improving
crop yield while at the same time improving the health and longevity of crop consumers.

The use of magnesium and calcium silicates as fertilizer has an even greater benefit than
improving human health, longevity, and crop yield: it removes carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) from the
atmosphere slowing global warming^480. The following two reactions summarize the natural
weathering of rocks, such as olivine (Mg 2 SiO 4 ) and wollastonite (CaSiO 3 ):

- Mg 2 SiO 4 + 4 CO 2 + 4 H 2 O -> 2 Mg++ + 4HCO 3 - + H 4 SiO 4 (OSA)
- CaSiO 3 + CO 2 + 2 H 2 O -> Ca++ + CO 3 -^2 + H 4 SiO 4 (OSA)

Both the weathering and fertilization processes are enhanced with natural soil organisms and by
milling the rock to increase its surface area^480. The carbonate (CO 3 -^2 ) and bicarbonate (HCO 3 - )
neutralize the soil by counteracting acid rain and ultimately, when dissolved in rain water runoff,
will counteract ocean acidification, an effect of rising CO 2480. The OSA formed by these
reactions fertilizes the soil improving crop yield and the health and longevity of crop consumers.

### Current Sources of Silica in the Diet

Silica from plants comes primarily from grains, vegetables, fruit, and products of grains and
fruit, such as beer and wine. Foods made from these plant sources make up what is called the
Mediterranean Diet that is a common thread of all six longevity regions. Table 23 provides
guidance on which foods have more silica content79,1^90 -^193. Note that high silica content does not
necessarily mean that the silica is dissolvable, absorbed, and therefore bioavailable. The
numbers in parenthesis are the percentage of absorbed and bioavailable silica in 100 grams of
food79,1^91 -^193. Foods too low in silica to be in this table include nuts, milk, milk products, meat,
and meat products79,1^91 -^193.



Fluids account for 20 to 30% of our dietary intake of OSA and the ingestion of solid foods
account for the rest. In order for OSA to be absorbed from solid foods these foods must be
hydrolyzed in the acidity of our gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Since the kidney is the major route for
silica excretion, urinary silicon levels are an indicator of silica absorption and bioavailability.

A semi-quantitative study was performed measuring the dietary intake of silica in foods eaten by
members of the Framingham study^192. A 126-item food frequency questionnaire was filled out
to get a measure of what is consumed on average by members of the study. A second part of the
study involved overnight fasting of healthy volunteers followed by ingestion of a test meal and
then 6 more hours of fasting. Throughout this period of time the volunteers only drank ultra-
high purity water containing negligible silicon content. Urine samples were taken and analyzed
for silicon as a measure of silica absorption and bioavailability. The results indicated that
between 13 and 62mg/day of silicon was ingested per day and 43% of this silicon was absorbed
and bioavailable as dissolved silica (OSA). The major food sources for silica among women
were bananas and string beans accounting for 17% of dietary silica intake. The major food
sources for silica among men were beer and bananas accounting for 25% of dietary silica intake.
Women in this study have less bioavailable silica than men because men consume more beer
than women. For children in this study the major dietary source of silica is from cereals (68% of
total dietary intake).

Most of the silicon in the grains, vegetables, and fruit we eat is in the husks, hulls, and skin.
Processed foods have the silica rich husks, hulls, and skins removed thereby lowering their silica
levels. Because of minimal processing our paleo hunter gatherer ancestors had a diet much
richer in silica than our modern diet. Note from the box plot in Figure 8 that as we age our serum
silicon levels decline^85. Intake of silica decreases with age in humans declining at a rate of
100 μg/year of age after age 39^192 ,193. This decline in intake of silica at least partially accounts
for why aluminum absorption in humans increases with age^194 resulting in an increased rate of
aluminum accumulation in elderly (75-101 years of age) versus non-elderly human brains^195.

Therefore, I recommend OSA supplementation particularly as you age and when you are
pregnant and breast feeding.


### Dietary Silica for Longevity

We have linked dissolved silica in water (i.e., OSA) to longevity in Chapter 3 and in this chapter
we have so far linked good health to eating grain, vegetables, and fruit high in bioavailable silica.
But does eating food high in bioavailable silica correlate with longevity? One factor that is
common to all longevity regions is that they are populated primarily with people who eat
unprocessed foods that contain more silica than processed foods. Examples taken from Table 23
include:

- Oats with husks and hulls contain 19 times more silica than processed dry oats used for
    porridge.
- Potatoes with skins contain 3 44 times more silica than potatoes peeled and boiled.
- Whole wheat grain contains 14 times more silica than high-fiber wheat bran cereal.

As testimony to longevity there is a family in Ireland named Donnelly that in 2017 had 13 living
siblings with a total age of 1075 years. This family has been made famous by being named the
oldest family in the world by the Guinness Book of World Records. When asked for the secret of
their longevity, Leo Donnelly 72 the youngest sibling claims “We have always followed Daddy’s
habit of that nice warm bite before sleep - porridge at around 10PM, then porridge again for
breakfast at 7AM - cooked oats, milk, and perhaps a spot of jam on top.”^196 So is there
something in the oat porridge that might be contributing to the Donnelly’s longevity?

In Ireland and Scotland there is Celtic oat porridge called sowans (a.k.a. sowens, virpa) that has
historically been very popular with the poor. Sowans is made from the husks (a.k.a. sids)
containing some residual meal left over after the milling process of oats. This oat porridge was
served both daily and traditionally on special occasions, such as Christmas Eve and/or Christmas
morning. Sowans is made by steeping oat husks in water for one to seven days (the longer the
more sour the product) and then straining out the undissolved husks. The strained liquid contains
a fine flowery meal that is allowed to settle out during a day of “fermenting”. This nutrient rich
starchy solid matter is boiled in salted water and served as sowans. The liquid drained off after
fermentation is called “sowan-swats” and used as a drink for children or substitute for milk in
baking or in tea^197 ,19^8.


It is a safe-bet that sowan and sowan-swats contains very high levels of bioavailable silica. From
Table 23 it can be calculated that a bowl of sowan made from 40 grams of oatmeal with husk and
hulls could provide as much as 117mg of bioavailable silica. This is unlike a bowl of 40 grams of
processed dry oats (i.e., porridge) that only provides 4. 8 mg of bioavailable silica.

So, what fruits and vegetables do people in longevity regions eat that could be adding silica to
their diets? Here is a brief synopsis of his study with foods ranked by their silicon content in
milligrams per 100gram serving^199 :

#### Okinawan Food

Sweet potatoes with skins ( 93 mg Si/100gr): Since the 17th century a staple of the Okinawan
diet has been the satsuma-imo a purple sweet potato. Also, its leaves are eaten as greens in miso
soup. The satsuma-imo was introduced to Okinawa from the Americas about 400 years ago and
took well to Okinawan soil. Before 1940 more than 60% of the calories consumed by Okinawans
were from the satsuma-imo. The traditional diet was about 80 percent carbohydrates.

Bitter melon (2.5mg Si/100gr): Names can be deceiving as this melon is a vegetable and not a
fruit. It looks like a type of cucumber and when green it can be bitter tasting. Usually, it is stir-
fried with a medley of vegetables in a dish called goya champuru.

Brown rice boiled with husks (2.1-3. 8 mg Si/100gr): Okinawans eat both brown and white rice
every day.

Comments About Okinawan Food: It is obvious based upon the relative amounts of silica in
these vegetables that the satsuma-imo provided the bulk of the silica assuming the skin was
eaten. But prior to the exponential increase in centenarians on Okinawa that occurred between
1974 and 2006 (see Figure 9 ) a fast-food invasion hit Okinawa. According to Japanese
Government Surveys between 1949 and 1960 dietary calories derived from sweet potatoes
declined from 60% to 5% and during this time rice consumption doubled and meat, eggs, and


poultry consumption increased more than sevenfold^199 ,^200. Not coincidentally cancers of the
lung, breast, and colon almost doubled by 1960^199 ,^201.

Okinawa was occupied by the U.S.A. for 27 years, from the end of World War II until 1972.
Despite of reversion back to Japanese rule, Okinawa still has a large presence of U.S.A. forces
that has continued to shape the islands culinary preferences. In 1963 the fast-food chain A&W
opened their first franchise outside of North America in Okinawa introducing root beer,
hamburgers, and fries. This fast food quickly became popular and by 2015 there were 26 A&W
locations on Okinawa^202. Okinawa has 8.2 hamburger joints per 100,000 people, more than
anywhere else in Japan^203. The fast-food invasion became a fusion of local and western tastes.
For instance, Blue Seal ice cream became available in Okinawa in 1948. This iconic U.S.A.
brand comes in 30 flavors, including satsuma-imo sweet potato flavor but without the skin and
silica^202.

Okinawan centenarians who were born around 1900 ingested high levels of OSA from two
different sources during their lives. The satsuma-imo sweet potato provided most of the OSA
during the first half of their lives and drinking water from the northern part of the island provided
most of the OSA during the last quarter of their lives. Fast-foods containing less than 1% of the
silicon content of the satsuma-imo sweet potato had a negative impact on Okinawan health from
1950 to 1974. However, after the Fukuji Reservoir began supplying drinking water to
Okinawans in 1974, the rise in dissolved silica in drinking water fully compensated for the fast-
food invasion by leading to an exponential increase in Okinawan centenarians.

#### Sardinian Food

Several researchers have looked back at what Sardinian’s, who became centenarians from 1980
to 2000, ate from birth to middle age. Nutritional data from the 1930’s was performed by both
Italian hygienist C. Fermi and dietary researcher G. Peretti^199 ,20^4 -^206. Fermi and Peretti found that
in a month, adults living in the Sardinian hills consumed the following^199 ,20^4 -^206.


Potatoes with skins ( 93 mg Si/100gr.): Sardinians consume potatoes as a major portion of their
84,000 calories per month.

Whole Grain Bread (2.3-4.8mg Si/100gr.): Wheat flour is made into 11 pounds of flat and
sourdough bread a month. Barley flour is made into 4 pounds of barley bread (a.k.a. orgiathu) a
month.

Red Wine (0. 7 mg Si/100gr): Sardinians drink 7 liters of Cannonau wine made from Grenache
grapes in a month. Although viewed as important for longevity wine may be over rated based
upon the fact that it contains less the 1% of the silica in barley and potatoes (see Table 23).

Comments About Sardinian Food: A factor in how the people living in Barbagia hill country
of Sardinia prepare food is that they are some of the poorest people in Italy. It is likely that all
parts of the grain and potato, including the hulls and skin, are prepared and eaten. In 1938 G.
Peretti, surveyed 2 8 farming families and 17 shepherd families living in three Sardinian
villages^199 ,2^06. Peretti found that on a calorie basis the people consumed the following:

- Carbohydrates from potatoes, bread, pasta, and beans – 65%
- Fat from goat’s milk, sheep’s cheese, and olive oil – 20%
- Protein primarily from beans and occasionally sheep, pig, and chicken (never fish) – 15%

Sardinian centenarians have eaten during their lives a diet rich in silica due to potatoes, bread,
pasta, and beans that in total provided 65% of their caloric intake. Fats and animal protein
provided 35% of their caloric intake and these foods are very low in silica. Protein was never
from fish as it was a two-day trip to the sea from the highlands.


#### Ikarian Food

Because of the island’s isolation the population has adhered to an old dietary culture that has
avoided western influence. The diet of Ikarians favors vegetables and whole grains and is based
around the following foods with percentage of daily intake in grams^199 :

Potatoes with skins ( 93 mg Si/100gr.): Boiled potatoes – 9%

Asparagus (18mg Si/100gr.): Plus vegetables from local gardens – 20%

Lentils (4.4mg Si/100gr.): Plus garbanzo beans and black-eyed peas - 11%

Whole Grain Bread (2.3-4.8mg Si/100gr.): Made into sourdough bread - ?%

Spring Greens (1.8mg Si/100gr.): As 150 varieties of wild greens grow on the island – 17%

Whole Grain Pasta (1.3mg Si/100gr.): - 5%

Red Wine (0. 7 mg Si/100gr): Ikarians drink a moderate amount of wine

Raw Fruit (0.1-2.5mg Si/100gr.): Lemons are used on everything and eaten with skin – 16%

Living on an island makes Ikarians careful to prepare and eat all parts of the grains and
vegetables they grow. Eating skins and husks increases the amount of silica they ingest.


#### Nicoyan Food

The Nicoya peninsula is geographically isolated from mainland Costa Rica isolating its
population from western culinary influence. In 1957 a Berkeley anthropologist by the name of
Phillip Wagner wrote a report entitled “Nicoya: a Cultural Geography”^207. In his report Wagner
describes the traditional food eaten daily by Nicoya farmers. A staple is gallo pinto made by
frying rice and beans in pork fat. This is eaten daily with corn (a.k.a. maize) tortillas and eggs.
Soups are also made with plantains, taro, or yucca. Sketches of local gardens indicated more than
40 edible plant species are grown including: papaya, yam, and bananas. The Nicoya diet also
includes a wide variety of forest fruits.

Dietary surveys indicate that 6 7 % of the Nicoya diet is carbohydrates that include: vegetables
14%, fruits 9%, legumes 7%, grains 26%, sugars 11%, and with the non-carbohydrates being
dairy 24 % and protein-fat 9 %^208. The portion of the Nicoya diet that is highest in OSA is the
following:

Yams unpeeled and boiled ( 93 mg Si/100gr.): Because of the low socioeconomic status of
Nicoyans, it is likely that yams are eaten unpeeled. Unrelated to North American sweet potatoes,
the Nicoyan yam is firm and white even when cooked.

Yams peeled and boiled (0.37mg Si/100gr.): It is unlikely yams are peeled before cooking in
Nicoya.

Bananas peeled (4.8-5.4mg Si/100gr.): They are a staple of Nicoya and eaten every day. These
include plantains that do not sweeten as they ripen and are usually fried.

Corn Tortillas (1.9-4.4mg Si/100gr.): Nicoyans make corn (a.k.a. maize nixamal or
nixquezado) tortillas and eat them as all three meals during the day. The corn is soaked in lime
in order to release niacin, and then ground into flour.

Black-Eyed and Black Beans boiled (1.2mg Si/100gr.): Nicoyans eat black beans almost
everyday


White Rice (1-2mg Si/100gr.): During the last 50 years white rice has replaced squash as a
staple food of Nicoya

Plums (0.25mg Si/100gr.): Pejivalles are an oval orange colored plum that is a staple food for
Nicoyans.

Raw Fruit (0.1-2.5mg Si/100gr.): Nicoyans eat one papaya daily.

Unpeeled yams are the major source of silica in the Nicoyan diet second only to Nicoyan
drinking water (17-41mg Si/liter). Bananas and corn tortillas are also important sources of silica
in the Nicoyan diet.

#### Adventist Food

Living in the U.S.A. it is hard to avoid fast food and prepared food that has been stripped of
silica. The Adventist lifestyle promotes eating local grown fruits and vegetables as 70% of their
caloric intake. The portion of the Adventist diet that is highest in OSA is the following:

Red Beets (21mg Si/100gr.): Seventy percent of the Adventist diet is fruits and vegetables.

Porridge made of processed dry oats (11.4mg Si/100gr.): Slow-cooked oatmeal is a staple for
Adventists. Many Adventists who are centenarians say that oatmeal is their breakfast.

Potatoes without skins (0.3-0.6mg Si/100gr.): In the U.S.A. we generally peel potatoes prior to
cooking. The skin of potatoes contains almost all of the silica (see Table 23).

Cucumbers (2.5mg Si/100gr.): Served and eaten fresh and raw with skin.

Green Beans (2.4-8.7mg Si/100gr.): Like green beans many beans and peas are eaten with the
shell. Seventy percent of the Adventist diet is fruits and vegetables.


Parsnips (2.3mg Si/100gr.): Fresh, peeled and boiled.

Avocados without skin and stone (0.64mg Si/100gr.): Avocados are high in potassium (30%
more than bananas) and are believed to reduced blood pressure and the risk of stroke.

Raw Fruit (0.1-2.5mg Si/100gr.): Seventy percent of the Adventist diet is fruits and vegetables.

The examples of local vegetables (e.g., red beets, potatoes, cucumbers, green beans, and
parsnips) are commonly sold at farmer’s markets in the U.S.A. and happen to contain relatively
high levels of silica. The amount of silica in vegetables and fruit grown in Loma Linda may be
higher than indicated in Table 23 because of local irrigation with silica rich ground water.

Adventists of Loma Linda, like the Donnelly family of Ireland, have adopted the habit of eating
oatmeal porridge at least once a day. A major potential difference is oatmeal sold in the U.S.A.
has been stripped of silica compared to the Irish oat porridge called sowans prepared by
fermentation of the oats and husks.

#### Bama Yao Food

The people of Bama Yao eat three times more vegetables than fruit and prepare their vegetables
by boiling, steaming, or stewing them, not by frying them. People eat only one to two meals a
day and only consume 1,400 to 1,500 calories a day. Their diet is low in meat and fat^473. The
people of Bama eat primarily locally grown pumpkin, sweet potatoes, bamboo shoots, tomatoes,
peppers, yellow corn, beans, and whole grains. The portion of the Bama Yao diet that is highest
in OSA is the following:

Pumpkins ( 70 - 350mg Si/100gr.): In Bama Yao pumpkins including leaves and seedlings are
stewed and eaten. Pumpkins grown in soil fertilized with calcium carbonate have only 70mg of
silicon per 100 grams while pumpkins fertilized with calcium silicate have 350mg of silicon per
100 grams^474. It is likely that irrigation with the OSA rich waters of Bama Yao results in OSA
rich pumpkins.


Sweet Potatoes with skins (93mg Si/100gr.): Because of the low socioeconomic status of
Bama Yao, it is likely that sweet potatoes are eaten unpeeled.

Bamboo Shoots (70-190mg Si/100gr.dry weight): The amount of silica in bamboo shoots
varies with species^475. The bioavailability of OSA from the silica in bamboo is only 1%^174.

### Conclusion of Dietary Bioavailable Dissolved Silica

There have been many books written recently on the health benefits of the Mediterranean diet.
Most of the ingredients used in this diet are summarized and ranked by their silicon content in
Table 23. Like OSA rich drinking water there is magic in the Mediterranean diet that results in
health and longevity. The dietary magic is water soluble OSA and water insoluble biosilifications
of SiO 2 , such as phytoliths. The OSA reverses aluminum accumulation in the body as shown in
Table 1 and 264. Both the biosilifications and OSA lowers aluminum absorption in the gut.
Because of this magic, eating a diet of primarily vegetables and fruit has been found to lower the
risk of three common fatal diseases:

- Cancer – Breast, Prostate, and Colorectal
- Dementia – Alzheimer’s
- Cardiovascular Disease – Stroke and Heart Attack

Aluminum is a likely causal factor of all three of these diseases^1. Lowering the risk of these three
terminal diseases and thereby increasing longevity has been found to correlate with daily
drinking silica water (see Chapter 3). We know that plants sequester OSA and other forms of
silica for protection from aluminum (see Chapter 2). Therefore, by consuming plants, humans are
ingesting the plant’s stores of silica and using that silica for their own protection from aluminum.

Of the 10 most produced crops of the world 8 are silica accumulators and all 9 of the most
produced crops in the U.S.A. are silica accumulators. In the U.S.A. production of these crops
removes approximately 10 million tons of silicon that is equivalent to 34 million tons of OSA


from the soil each year. Silica levels in these crops are declining because silica is not used as
fertilizer. Silica supplementation to croplands does enhance both the yield and silica level of the
edible portion of these crops. In the six longevity regions of the world crop irrigation with silica
rich water provides a healthy OSA supplement to crops.

In all longevity regions, except Loma Linda, eating unpeeled potatoes or yams has either
provided or currently provides the highest source of daily dietary silica second only to drinking
silica rich water. In the U.S.A. most people peel potatoes prior to cooking and eating. For this
reason, in the U.S.A. silica ingestion comes primarily from drinking water, but only in those
communities with high levels of silica in their drinking water, such as Loma Linda. A secondary
daily source of silica in Loma Linda is oat meal porridge.


## Chapter 5 – Silica Water for Healing

```
“ Fortunate is the person who is able to understand the causes of things ” – Virgil 29 BC
```
Living in the Aluminum Age negatively impacts the health of everyone as we all accumulate
aluminum just by eating and drinking. Where we accumulate aluminum in our bodies and how
much aluminum we accumulate is subject to individual variation. This accounts for why
aluminum accumulation impacts people’s health in many different ways. This chapter describes
healing from both aluminum accumulation and diseases and disorders in which aluminum is
likely a causal factor. Facilitating excretion of aluminum by drinking OSA rich silica water
allows us to heal from the toxic effects of aluminum and diseases and disorders caused by
aluminum. It takes a resilient spirit to make a lifestyle choice of drinking OSA rich silica water,
but as you will see in this chapter, OSA can heal aluminum damage and provide dividends in
extended healthy individual longevity.

### Aluminum Toxicity and Exposure

Before describing diseases and disorders in which aluminum is a causal factor we must talk
about aluminum poisoning. Both acute and chronic aluminum poisoning is due to excessive
exposure to aluminum. Because both aluminum and traumatic brain damage weakens the blood
brain barrier (BBB), some humans are more vulnerable than others to aluminum’s toxicity. This
vulnerability has increased in the Aluminum Age because of increased exposure to aluminum
containing products.

#### Acute Aluminum Poisoning

Aluminum ions kill neurons and for this reason it is accepted that aluminum is neurotoxic and
neurodegenerative. The toxicity of aluminum ions in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) on the brain
side of the blood brain barrier (BBB) is underscored by two patients who underwent routine
brain surgery requiring bone cement. The cements used were of a new type that contained labile
aluminum ions^209. After the operations their CSF had 63-112mcg per liter of aluminum. The
patients never regained consciousness and died 80- 143 days after their operations^210.


In order to put this 63-112mcg per liter of aluminum in the CSF in some perspective, over half
the alum treated surface drinking water in the U.S.A. contains aluminum at over 100mcg per liter
(ppb) (see Table 20 ). So, aluminum in the CSF at concentrations found in most U.S.A. alum
treated surface drinking waters would be considered fatally neurotoxic. There are two barriers
preventing aluminum from being transferred from drinking water to the CSF: absorption from
the gut to the blood and transfer across the BBB to the CSF.

In humans, acute aluminum poisoning has been studied in uremic patients who are on dialysis
because of kidney failure. Acute aluminum poisoning is caused by high levels of aluminum in
the dialysate, the co-ingestion of aluminum containing phosphate binders and citrate, or the rapid
rise in blood serum aluminum following desferoxamine inoculation^211. Desferoxamine is an FDA
approved iron and aluminum chelator administered by inoculation for treatment of acute iron
poisoning, but not for treatment of acute aluminum poisoning. In acute aluminum poisoning
blood serum levels of aluminum are greater than 500mcg per liter where normal levels in the
blood serum are only 1 to 3mcg per liter212,21^3. The onset of neurotoxicity is rapid and marked by
confusion, muscle twitching, grand mal seizures, coma, and death.

#### Chronic Aluminum Exposure

Chronic aluminum exposure is very common in humans because aluminum is in drinking water,
food, cookware, colored candy, pharmaceuticals, vaccines, and even inhaled air. Symptoms of
chronic aluminum exposure are a gradual onset of neurobehavioral disorders and eventually
death. These symptoms have been observed in both adults and children. Common neurological
disorders that have been linked to chronic aluminum exposure are Alzheimer’s disease, autism,
multiple sclerosis, seizures, and Parkinson’s diesease^1. These neurological disorders and
evidence that OSA rich silica water can be used to heal them will be discussed in this chapter.

#### Blood-Brain-Barrier’s Role in Preventing Aluminum Toxicity

The blood-brain-barrier (BBB) saves us from certain death due to acute and chronic aluminum
exposure. The BBB is made of cells (i.e., cerebrovascular endothelial cells) that are wedged
tightly together to form a barrier that restricts the movement of ions, such as aluminum, between
the blood and the brain. These cells are only the first layer of defense against aluminum entering


the brain from the blood stream. The second layer of defense involves three types of cells on the
brain side of the BBB called astrocytes, microglial cells, and pericytes. Primary factors causing
increased BBB permeability to aluminum include:

- Aluminum^214 -^217
- Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)^218

Aluminum oxide as nanoparticles, when exposed to human brain microvascular endothelial cells,
decrease expression of the tight-junction proteins: F-actin and occludin^217. This is not observed
with nanoparticles of carbon^217. Aluminum administered to juvenile rats also decreases
expression of F-actin and occludin. F-actin is a protein for endothelial cell-to-cell adhesion and
occludin is a plasma-membrane protein located at tight-junctions between endothelium cells^216.
Both of these molecules, whose expression is decreased by aluminum, are the “cement” that
bonds the cerebrovascular endothelial cells together forming the first layer of BBB defense.

Once the first layer of defense is penetrated, aluminum can attack the astrocytes and microglial
cells on the brain side of the BBB^219. Aluminum ions cause inflammation in the brain by
inducing both astrocytes and microglial cells to produce neurotoxic chemicals called reactive
oxygen species (ROS)^219. Aluminum is much more efficient than any other metal ion in inducing
ROS production in human glial cells as tested in vitro^219. This allows aluminum to penetrate the
second layer of defense and enter the brain from the blood stream.

Two factors, aging and autism, and four diseases that are associated with increased BBB
permeability are:

- Ageing^222
- Autism - In autism aluminum is concentrated in microglial cells^65
- Alzheimer’s Disease^220
- Vascular Disease – High Blood Pressure and Stroke^221
- Parkinson’s Disease223,224
- Lyme Disease^225


#### Causal Inference and the Ladder of Causation

The study of causality has recently seen a major advance as described by Judea Pearl and Dana
Mackenzie in their 2018 book entitled “The Book of Why”^453. This advance is called causal
inference and one of its main accomplishments is construction of a mathematical query of
causation expressed with a “Do” operator. For instance, longevity region longevity is increased
in those people who “Do” drink OSA rich water and eat OSA rich vegetables. This can be
expressed as the causal query: What is the increased survival rate (P) of 60-to- 79 - year-olds
having sufficient longevity (L) to live to 90+ by ingesting OSA in water and vegetables. The
mathematical form of this query is P(L | do(OSA). The answer to this query depends on the
longevity region. For instance, in Okinawa P = 3.1% for males and 5.8% for females (see Table
4 ).

In order to explain why silica water causes an increase in lifespan, a hypothesis is proposed and
tested by the ladder of causation. The hypothesis proposed in this book is that since drinking
silica water facilitates the excretion of aluminum from the body, aluminum accumulation in the
body is a cause of shortened lifespan. This can be represented by the following causal diagram:

```
OSA → Lowers the Body’s Accumulated Aluminum → Increases Longevity
```
Applying the three-rung ladder of causation this hypothesis can be tested:

- First Rung **–** Association: between increasing aluminum exposure and increasing rate
    of one or more terminal diseases. Association: epidemiology studies correlating
    aluminum in drinking water with increased incidence of one or more terminal diseases.
- Second Rung **–** Intervention: controlled experiments showing that drinking OSA rich
    water facilitates the excretion of accumulated aluminum (see Chapter 2). Intervention:
    controlled experiments to find if aluminum accumulation in the body is associated with
    terminal diseases. Intervention: experiments that test for aluminum modulating key
    biochemical pathways associated with terminal diseases.


- Third Rung **–** Counterfactuals: “It is a myth that aluminum causes terminal diseases”
    and “It is impossible that by drinking OSA rich water and eating OSA rich vegetables
    people can heal terminal diseases”. Understanding: will negate these two statements.

#### Increasing Aluminum Exposure

Human exposure to aluminum has increased exponentially since the beginning of the Aluminum
Age. The Aluminum Age began in 1888 when a low-cost process to purify aluminum from
bauxite was developed by Karl Joseph Bayer. Since that time worldwide aluminum production
has exponentially increased as well as the incidence of Alzheimer’s and autism (see Figures 22
and 2 3 ). These neurological disorders are not ancient but instead have grown from only a few
known cases to millions of cases over the last century of the Aluminum Age. These two
disorders were discovered by psychiatrists with years of experience working with a single unique
case that differed from all cases they had previously examined.

In 1888 Doctor Alois Alzheimer began working at a psychiatric hospital in Frankfort Germany.
Thirteen years later, at age 35, Doctor Alzheimer started observing a hospital patient named
Auguste Deter. She had unique and new behavioral symptoms and had lost her short-term
memory. After she died in 1906 her brain was autopsied by Dr. Alzheimer. Using special stains
he found beta-amyloid (AB) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and in his own words
after translation:

```
“The case presented even in the clinic such a different picture, that it could not be
categorized under known disease headings, and also anatomically it provided a result
that departed from all previously known disease pathology”^226
```
The prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease has grown exponentially since 1906 and is
simultaneously correlated with the growth of worldwide aluminum production as plotted in
Figure 22.


In 1930 Doctor Leo Kanner began developing a child psychiatry service at John Hopkin’s
Hospital in Baltimore. Eight years later he started observing a child with a unique and new
syndrome that he considered a modern disease. His belief is supported by the fact that it took him
eight years working as a child psychiatrist to find his first case of autism and five more years to
find 10 more cases. A child psychiatrist working in similar position today would find his first
case of autism in a week, if not sooner. In 201 6 it was estimated that 1 in 32 children born in the
U.S.A. has autism. This corresponds to 110,000 autistic children born during 201 6 in the U.S.A.

The prevalence of autism has grown exponentially since 1938 and is simultaneously correlated
with the growth of worldwide aluminum production as plotted in Figure 23.


A relatively recent genetic mutation can’t explain the approximate 8 0 years of exponential
growth of both AD and autism. This is because during the last 200 years the average human
generation time is 30 years with only three generations in 90 years^1. What can explain the
exponential growth of both AD and autism is an environmental factor whose production and
chronic exposure to humans has exponentially increased since its introduction. Aluminum is a
likely causal factor as it is currently used in drinking water treatment, food, pharmaceuticals,
cookware, colored candy, vaccines, and inhaled air. Aluminum is also a likely causal factor
because it is neurotoxic and causes neurodegeneration a common symptom of both AD and
autism.

Both AD and autism are modern mismatch diseases in which our evolved mechanisms for
aluminum protection are failing to protect us from an exponential increase in aluminum
exposure^1. There are other mismatch diseases in which aluminum is likely a causal factor. In all
cases these mismatch diseases can be prevented and healed with supplemental OSA rich water
and by eating OSA rich vegetables.

We have begun climbing the ladder of causation and are on the first rung. The next sub-chapters
will allow us to climb to the top of the ladder and show how it is possible for OSA to prevent and
heal several terminal diseases.


### Alzheimer’s Disease

My interest in silica water was inspired by a desire to help my mother slow or possibly reverse
the progression of her Alzheimer’s disease. I read Dr. Christopher Exley’s work on daily silica
water treatments improving cognition in some Alzheimer’s patients and hoped this might work
for my mom73,^78. My research on Alzheimer’s disease and ways to prevent it are summarized in
my book “Prevent Alzheimer’s, Autism, and Stroke with 7 Supplements, 7 Lifestyle Choices,
and a Dissolved Mineral”^1. The dissolved mineral mentioned in the title refers to the water-
soluble silica called orthosilicic acid (OSA).

Alzheimer’s disease is a terminal disease that slowly erases ones memory and identity. In the
U.S.A. we are witnessing an exponentially growing epidemic of Alzheimer’s (see Figure 22 ).
Currently 700,000 people in the U.S.A. die every year from Alzheimer’s making it the sixth
leading cause of death. It is estimated that 1 out of 3 people in the U.S.A. over 80 have
Alzheimer’s.

But Alzheimer’s is not an inevitable part of ageing. There are locations in the world, such as
Japan and Okinawa, with a longer life expectancy than the U.S.A. and where there is much lower
percentage of people dying from Alzheimer’s than in the U.S.A. (see Table 24). These areas of
the world have on average much higher levels of OSA in their drinking water than the U.S.A.

In Table 24 both male and female survival rates are the percentage of people 60 to 79 who will
make it to age 90 in each location. This table shows that both male and female survival rate to
age 90 is higher in Mainland Japan (i.e., Honshu) and Okinawa than the U.S.A. The table also


shows the Alzheimer’s death rate in the U.S.A. compared with Mainland Japan and Okinawa is
inversely correlated with average ppm OSA in drinking water. This OSA rich water is used for
both drinking and crop irrigation.

The seven largest epidemiology studies looking at the link between aluminum in drinking water
and the risk of Alzheimer’s have found over 100ppb of aluminum in drinking water increases the
risk of Alzheimer’s^1. In addition, several of these studies found a dose response relationship
between the concentration of aluminum and the risk of Alzheimer’s^238 -^246. The good news is that
one long-term study found that OSA greater than 18ppm in drinking water lowered the risk of
Alzheimer’s^246 ,2^47. A second long-term study also confirmed that women over 75 drinking OSA
rich water 19 ppm to 57ppm were less likely to be diagnosed with Alzheimer’s and had higher
cognitive performance than women drinking water with less than 19 ppm OSA^248.

#### Biomarkers for Alzheimer’s

Three genes and an environmental factor (i.e., aluminum) have been linked as causal factors to
Alzheimer’s disease. There are three types and two sub-types of Alzheimer’s disease (AD):

- Sporadic AD is the most common type (98-99% of AD patients) with two sub-types:
    o Those without  4 allele of APOE gene ( 44 % of sporadic AD patients in
       U.S.A.)^249
    o Those with one or more copies of 4 allele of the APOE gene ( 56 % of sporadic
       AD patients in U.S.A. and 50% of early-onset AD patients)^249 ,25^0
- Familial AD with presenilin 1 or presenilin 2 genes (1-2% of AD patients in U.S.A. and
    35 to 75% of early-onset familial AD patients)^251
- Occupational AD is the least common with at least one case of early-onset AD due to
    aluminum reported in the scientific literature^252

Twenty percent of people in the U.S.A. have one or more copies of the  4 allele of the APOE
gene. These people have a 50% greater than normal chance of having sporadic AD. This makes
the APOE- 4 gene a potential causal factor of AD but not a reliable biomarker for AD (see
“Aluminum and the Risk of AD in People with the APOE- 4 Gene” at the end of this chapter).


People with the presenilin genes are almost certain of having familial AD, making the presenilin
genes biomarkers for AD.

In addition to these genetic biomarkers, there are three biomarkers common to all types of AD:

- Aluminum hotspots in the frontal and entorhinal cortex and hippocampus of the brain
- Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) of tau protein in the frontal cortex of the brain
- Beta-amyloid (AB) plaque in the frontal cortex of the brain

All of these biomarkers are visible microscopically in the autopsied brain with appropriate stains.
The NFT’s and AB plaque were discovered in 1906 by Doctor Alzheimer and the aluminum
hotspots were first noted in 1973 by Crapper^253. Recently there have been procedures developed
for analyzing for these biomarkers in living patients (i.e., in vivo) by sampling cerebrospinal
fluid or serum^254 -^256 or completely non-invasively by PET or MRI scans of the brain^257 ,2^58.
Retinal fluorescent lifetime and optical imaging of the eye has also been used to screen for some
of these biomarkers^259 -^262.

Warning: In vivo detection of genetic and non-genetic biomarkers of Alzheimer’s is in its
infancy and suffers from high levels of false-positives and false-negatives. In addition, a
percentage of the population can be resilient to the effects of some biomarkers. For example,
23.2% of a group of 966 people in two combined studies who had both a brain autopsy after
death and comprehensive cognitive testing proximate to death were found to be resilient to beta-
amyloid (AB) plaque in their brains. The 224 people found to be resilient had a significant
amount of AB-plaque in their brains but no symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease and were therefore
without an Alzheimer’s diagnosis at the time of death^263 ,2^64.

#### Aluminum as a Causal Factor of Alzheimer’s

From aluminum analysis of the brains of those who had early or late onset AD and died of
sporadic AD, familial AD, and occupational AD, it has been concluded that median levels of
aluminum in excess of 2.0mcg per gram dry weight of brain across all four main lobes is both a
common characteristic of AD and a contributor to its etiology^265. There have been a total of 242
brains autopsied from people diagnosed with AD. In all cases these brains were found to have
higher than normal levels of aluminum252,^265 - 267,^486 ,^487.


In 2005 aluminum levels in specific brain regions in three AD patients and three non-demented
controls was measured^266. The data in Table 25 shows regions of the brain where there were
aluminum hotspots. In these regions aluminum is preferentially absorbed at higher levels in AD
patients than non-demented controls^266.

In 2011 Rusina et al. measured both aluminum and mercury in the hippocampus and associated
visual cortex of 27 controls and 29 histologically-confirmed AD cases. There was a four-fold
increase in aluminum levels in the hippocampus of the AD cases versus the controls. There was
no difference in mercury levels between the AD cases and controls^267. An amount as high as
8mcg/g of aluminum per gram dry weight of brain tissue has been found in the inferior parietal
lobe of AD patients^268. Hotspots in human brains with AD typically are in excess of 4mcg/g dry
weight of brain tissue^268. They contain a large number of NFTs or large pyramidal cells with
high levels of aluminum. Hotspots are not found in non-demented age-matched controls^268.

It has been shown that a causal factor of all types of AD is environmental and not genetic^1. Out
of all environmental factors considered, only aluminum experimentally triggers all major
histopathological events associated with Alzheimer’s^269. The “hotspots” in the brain where the
highest levels of aluminum were found include the hippocampal complex, entorhinal cortex, and
frontal cortex^266. These areas of the brain are all important for memory. Impaired memory is the
core clinical feature of AD. The entorhinal cortex had the highest overall aluminum levels, is
amongst the earliest regions of the brain to develop NFTs, and is ultimately the most damaged
region of the brain in AD^270 -^273.


Some brain atrophy in the hippocampal complex and the frontal cortex (i.e., 0.3-0.6%) is
common with age in healthy adults^274. In 2009 Fjell et al. studied brain atrophy in people 60- 91
years old. The study included 142 healthy participants and 122 with AD. The four areas of the
brain found to significantly atrophy during one year in AD patients were the same areas found to
be hotspots for aluminum accumulation. Also, the rate of atrophy is much higher in AD brains
than in healthy adult brains as shown in Table 26275. Of course, even healthy brains have
accumulated some aluminum and that could account for the atrophy observed in the controls.

There is ample evidence that aluminum is a causal factor of Alzheimer’s, while there is evidence
that AB-plaque and NFTs are merely symptoms of aluminum accumulation in the brain^1.
Currently billions of dollars are being invested in research to develop drugs for removal of AB
plaque and NFTs from the human brain. Even if successful, these drugs will only provide
palliative relief as they are only addressing symptoms and not a causal factor of Alzheimer’s. I
am not aware of any research dollars being currently spent on how to remove the causal factor -
aluminum from the human brain. This is sadly ironic because on earth we have been blessed with
low-cost silica to reverse aluminum accumulation.

Drinking OSA rich silica water daily has improved the cognition of many people suffering from
AD in addition to my mother, now 9 6 , who drank silica rich water daily for 5 years and still has
enough memory to describe what she has done recently. This information comes from a
facebook page my wife, Laurie Adamson, moderates: Alzheimer’s: Late and Early Onset,
APOE- 4 https://www.facebook.com/groups/509038829797535 :


- _“I am the 3rd generation diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. It runs very strong in my family._

    from my brain for almost 5 months and I can drive again and go shopping by myself
    again. Also doing memory block video puzzles. My scores are more than triple after

#### The Fly in the Ointment

Are the potential profits from future Alzheimer’s drug sales or the current profit from aluminum
sales preventing the evaluation of low cost and more natural solutions to Alzheimer’s, such as
adding supplemental silica to drinking water? Silica as a treatment does not fit the drug
company’s model of a successful drug (i.e., it is not a patentable pill or an inoculation that
provides quick relief). Silica supplementation as a drinking water treatment needs to be both
implemented by public health departments and embraced as an additive to domestic bottled
water.

Obfuscation, paid for by the aluminum industry, has put aluminum research temporarily on hold.
The aluminum industry has paid some scientists to publish articles on why aluminum does not
cause Alzheimer’s. Typically, these articles point out that people with kidney failure on
hemodialysis have high levels of aluminum in their blood but don’t have a high incidence of
Alzheimer’s disease. They fail to mention that people with kidney failure can’t eliminate both
OSA and aluminum by urination and have high levels of both of them in their blood as shown in
Table 27276 ,2^77.

With a working blood-brain-barrier, the OSA keeps the aluminum in the brain’s cerebrospinal
fluid at lower levels (i.e., 3 - 7 mcg/liter) as shown in Table 27^276. Approximately 4% of
hemodialysis patients have a damaged blood-brain-barrier and die in a year or less due to
aluminum quickly accumulating in the brain causing dementia (i.e., aluminum encephalopathy)
in spite of high levels of silica. Since Alzheimer’s disease takes 5 to 20 years before symptoms
develop, hemodialysis patients with a damaged blood-brain-barrier die of aluminum
encephalopathy long before they can develop Alzheimer’s.


In 1998 a group under the leadership of J.D. Birchall found that high silica levels in the blood of
hemodialysis patients lowered their aluminum levels^278. They concluded:

```
“Further work needs to confirm a preventive role for silicon in the accumulation and
subsequent toxicity of aluminum in dialysis patients.”^278
```
For those hemodialysis patients with a working BBB, the silica and aluminum form particles of
HAS at the BBB preventing both Alzheimer’s and high levels of aluminum in their brains^279.

#### Aluminum and the Risk of AD in People with the APOE- 4 Gene

The APOE- 4 gene increases the concentration of beta-amyloid peptide in the brain and has been
linked to a higher risk of AD. The  4 allele of the APOE gene was introduced into the human
population at least 1.5 million years ago^280. The reproductive advantage of carrying the  4 allele
was to promote human fertility in highly infectious environments in spite of its adverse effects
on late onset diseases (i.e., an example of antagonistic pleiotropy)^281. Because of this
reproductive advantage the  4 allele frequency slowly increased during the last 1.5 million years
with currently approximately 14% of the worldwide population carrying the  4 allele^280.


Because of improved hygiene and vaccines there is no longer a reproductive advantage to those
that carry the  4 allele. In the absence of a reproductive advantage, the  4 allele frequency in the
worldwide human population is not predicted to change (i.e., the Hardy-Weinberg principle).

Therefore, the recent exponential growth of AD is not due to an exponential increase in  4 allele
frequency. Instead, the exponential growth of AD is due to a newly introduced environmental
chemical that potentiates APOE- 4 making one of its protein products or their derivatives, such
as oligomeric beta-amyloid peptide, more neurotoxic. This was proven to be the case by Denise
Drago in 2008 when she tested a variety of metal ions (e.g., aluminum, iron, zinc, and copper)
and found that only aluminum when bound to the oligomeric beta-amyloid peptide resulted in
significantly increased neurotoxicity^282.

Aluminum is a causal factor of AD in people with and without the  4 allele of the APOE gene,
but in those with this allele there is more oligomeric beta-amyloid for aluminum to toxify. For
this reason, usually those with the APOE- 4 gene have a higher risk of AD than those without
the  4 allele. But what if there is an exception? What if there is an undiscovered longevity
region on earth where people with the APOE- 4 gene have the same risk of AD as those without
the APOE- 4 gene? What if people in this undiscovered longevity region drink OSA rich water
and eat an OSA rich diet that lowers their aluminum body-burden to the point where they are
protected from the APOE- 4 gene?

```
The Exception – Ibadan, Nigeria an Undiscovered Longevity Region
```
The exception to APOE- 4 being a causal factor of AD is the Yoruba people of Ibadan, Nigeria
who coincidentally have the same  4 allele frequency as people in the U.S.A. From 1992 to 2006
the APOE gene was genotyped in 2,245 elderly Nigerians living in the city of Ibadan who were
also clinically diagnosed. Surprisingly, in contrast with other populations, the  4 allele in the
Yoruba people was not significantly associated with AD or dementia^283.


The Yoruba people living in Ibadan are in general in better health than people living in the
U.S.A. Age-matched annual incidence rates of both dementia and AD were found to be 2.4 and
2.2 times lower respectively, in a longitudinal study of a cohort of 2,459 elderly Yoruba people
living in Ibadan versus a cohort of 2,147 elderly African-Americans living in Indianapolis,
Indiana^284. In addition, these elderly Yoruba people have lower incidence of vascular disease
and vascular risk factors including hypertension than does the age matched cohort of elderly in
the U.S.A.^283.

```
OSA in Ibadan ’s Drinking Water
```
Ibadan, Nigeria has a community water system that distributes water from the Eleyele reservoir.
Tap water sampled at 11 sites across the distribution system indicated the water contained OSA
at 22.4 to 25.6ppm^285. This level of OSA in drinking water is approximately the same as average
drinking water on mainland Japan (i.e., 26ppm) and more than twice the level of U.S.A. drinking
water (i.e., 11ppm). This more than 2-fold increase of OSA in drinking water is associated with
a more than a 10 - fold lower rate of death due to AD in Japan versus the U.S.A. (see Table 9).

It is not surprising that both the Yoruba people of Ibadan and Japanese living on mainland Japan
both have lower incidence rates of AD than people in the U.S.A., since OSA in drinking water
lowers the body-burden of aluminum, a causative factor of AD. It is also not surprising that
among the Yoruba people of Ibadan the  4 allele was not significantly associated with AD or
dementia, since without a body-burden of aluminum there is no increase in neurotoxicity of
oligomeric beta-amyloid. This is the peptide that occurs in higher-than-normal levels in those
people with the APOE- 4 gene.

```
OSA in Ibadan’s Food
```
Nigeria is the leading worldwide producer of cassava with annual production of 4 5 million
metric tons^286. Cassava, the most important dietary staple in Nigeria, is a tuber whose skin is
very rich in OSA^286 ,^287. This makes cassava one of the richest vegetable dietary sources of silicon


as OSA (i.e., approximately 270 mg of silicon per 100 grams of cassava with skin that is
equivalent to 920mg of OSA per 100 grams – see Table 23)^28 6,28^7.

The cassava root is toxic if not treated properly. Although cassava can be peeled with some
difficulty, the tuber is usually cut into pieces with the skin on, dried, and fermented, in order to
eliminate toxicity, and finally converted into three main foods by the Yoruba people^288.

```
Gari – granular cassava flour with a ferment flavor and a slightly sour taste is eaten in
stews and soups and served with fried fish. Gari is also used as a snack when mixed with
milk and sugar.
```
```
Fufu – cassava flour mixed into a paste with hot or cold water is ranked next to gari as an
indigenous food of the Yoruba people.
```
```
Lafun – fibrous powdery form of cassava that is made into dough with boiling water.
```
The Yoruba people of Ibadan are a living example of how increased dietary OSA in their
drinking water and food can lower the aluminum toxification of the oligomeric beta-amyloid
peptide. This is the peptide that occurs in higher-than-normal levels in those people with the
APOE- 4 gene. By following the example of the Yoruba people of Ibadan and increasing
dietary OSA by consuming OSA rich drinking water and OSA rich food, the risk of AD is
significantly decreased in everyone either with or without the APOE- 4 gene.

#### Silica Water Protects Amyloid Beta Regulation

Why are annual incidence rates of both dementia and AD 2.4 and 2.2 times lower respectively in
Ibadan, Nigeria than in the U.S.A.? The answer is OSA in the drinking water and food of
Ibadan’s inhabitants protects amyloid beta (-amyloid) regulation in their brains. Amyloid beta
is a 36-43 amino acid peptide that is neurotoxic causing inflammation of neurons that can result
in cellular death. Excess amyloid beta can also result in plaques in the brain that are a hallmark
of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Due its neurotoxicity amyloid beta is normally regulated in the
brain. Amyloid beta regulation involves not producing too much amyloid beta and quickly
degrading the amyloid beta that is produced to non-toxic fragments. Aluminum interferes with


both of these processes. Drinking OSA rich water and eating OSA rich vegetables facilitates
aluminum excretion, thereby protecting amyloid beta regulation.

Amyloid beta is made enzymatically in the brain by a series of enzymes that cleave off chunks of
amyloid precursor protein (APP). -secretase 1 (BACE-1) is one of the enzymes involved in
making amyloid beta. Aluminum epigenetically increases expression of -secretase favoring the
production of more amyloid beta289,290.

Oligomers of amyloid beta (dimers, trimers, tetramers, etc.) are neurotoxic. Aluminum
complexes of these amyloid beta oligomers are spherical droplets that are even more neurotoxic
than amyloid beta oligomers^282. Aluminum “freezes” the amyloid beta oligomer by inhibiting its
further degradation to smaller fragments^291. The rate-limiting step in the degradation of amyloid
beta is catalyzed by the enzyme neprilysin. Aluminum epigenetically decreases expression of
neprilysin that favors more amyloid beta in the brain289,290.

Drinking OSA rich water and eating OSA rich vegetables decreases aluminum in the brain and
restores amyloid beta regulation. In addition, OSA prevents amyloid beta oligomers from
becoming more neurotoxic. Treatment for high levels of amyloid beta in the brain can also be
done with aerobic exercise, and sleep. Aerobic exercise for 30 minutes increases the level of
somatostatin in the brain that in turn decreases amyloid beta by increasing the activity of
neprilysin^1. Aerobic exercise also increases hippocampal volume^292. In addition, sleep increases
somatostatin expression and facilitates the purging of amyloid beta from the brain1,293.

**Conclusion of Alzheimer’s** Disease - Alzheimer’s disease is the most common cause of
dementia in the world. In Okinawa there is 52% less dementia than in Mainland Japan (i.e.,
Honshu) and 96% less dementia than in the U.S.A. (see Table 9). In Ikaria there is 25% less
dementia than on mainland Greece. These longevity regions have less dementia due to higher
levels of OSA in their drinking water and food. This OSA facilitates the elimination in urine and
sweat of accumulated aluminum in the people’s brains.


Aluminum is a neurotoxin that kills neurons in regions of the brain responsible for memory. In
addition, aluminum causes neurodegeneration and brain atrophy in these same regions. Atrophy
in these brain regions is seen in those suffering with Alzheimer’s disease. There is ample
evidence that aluminum is a causal factor of Alzheimer’s^1. In spite of this scientific evidence, the
U.S. Alzheimer’s Association, U.S. aluminum industry, and U.S. biopharmaceutical industry all
actively deny the validity of this evidence establishing aluminum as a causal factor. In addition,
they have failed to recognize the connection between OSA and aluminum detoxification as a
preventative for Alzheimer’s.

Removing aluminum from the human brain with daily OSA ingestion as a method of preventing
and reversing Alzheimer’s disease is based upon scientific evidence73,78, 2^46 -^248. The information
in this book on how silica increases longevity also provides evidence that terminal diseases
including Alzheimer’s can be prevented and reversed with OSA in drinking water and food.
There is also anecdotal evidence that daily OSA ingestion reverses Alzheimer’s. For instance,
my mother at age 92 has now healed her brain and reversed her Alzheimer’s symptoms by daily
drinking Fiji silica water (for details see Chapter 3 – Marion Iowa).


### Atherosclerosis

Unlike many organs of the body in which silicon increases with age, such as kidney, brain, liver,
spleen, and lung, silicon decreases with age in the plasma, aorta, and other arterial
vessels85,^294 ,2^95. The impact of less silicon in the circulatory system is development of
atherosclerosis that is a general stiffening or hardening of the aorta and other arterial vessels
resulting in higher blood pressure and a greater incidence of fatal coronary heart disease and
stroke^296. In the U.S.A. fatal coronary heart disease and stroke kill over three-quarters of a
million people a year and are the first and fifth highest causes of death, respectively^297.

One of the first studies to reveal that dissolved silica in drinking water is an important factor in
prevention of coronary heart disease was conducted by Klaus Schwarz. This longitudinal study
was conducted between 1959 and 1974 and involved two groups of men: one group living in
Eastern Finland and one group living in Western Finland^298. In both groups smoking and obesity
were approximately the same. The death rate from coronary heart disease was twice as high in
the Eastern Finland group as in the Western Finland group. The only variable that could explain
this large difference in coronary heart disease was the amount of silica in the drinking water as
tested by Schwarz and shown in Table 28. The water samples were taken from private wells that
had not undergone any changes for a number of years.

Coincidentally both mainland Japan and Western Finland have 26ppm of OSA on average in
drinking water. While the U.S.A. has on average only 11ppm of OSA in drinking water (see
Table 4 ). According to worldlifeexpectancy.com the death rate due to cardiovascular disease in
men is 2.5 times higher in the U.S.A. than in mainland Japan. This is slightly higher than the
factor of 2 differences in death rates due to cardiovascular disease in Eastern versus Western
Finland. The 0.5% difference may be due to Eastern Finland having 5ppm more OSA in drinking
water on average than the U.S.A.


Do high levels of aluminum in the blood cause coronary heart disease and stroke? This question
was answered in an occupational health study of aluminum workers^299. Forty workers exposed
to aluminum while working in an aluminum factory were compared with 40 non-exposed
subjects of comparable age who worked in administration at the same factory. The age range of
the subjects was 18 to 62. The workers had been chronically exposed to aluminum dust levels of
0.33 to 3.4mg per cubic meter of air without any protective equipment. The study included a
clinical examination of medical records as well as blood tests for aluminum. Aluminum blood
levels of the exposed group were on average nearly 10 times higher than the control. The results
of the clinical examination revealed a much higher frequency of both heart attacks and strokes in
the exposed group. In fact, 5 of the 40 exposed workers had a stroke and 14 of the 40 had heart
attacks. This compared with 2 cases of possible stroke with a symptom of a paralyzed limb (i.e.,
monoplegia) and 4 cases of heart attacks in the control group as shown in Table 29. Therefore,
aluminum exposure is a likely causal factor of coronary heart disease and stroke.

Note that exposure to aluminum lowers L-carnitine in the serum by more than 50%^299. L-
carnitine acts as a chaperone that facilitates the transfer of large fatty acids into the mitochondria
so they can be oxidized and metabolized for energy production. Aluminum lowers L-carnitine
levels by inhibiting two enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of L-carnitine^300 and inhibiting the
activation of an enzyme (i.e., MS) involved in the biosynthesis of a precursor of L-carnitine (i.e.,
methionine) from homocysteine100,101. Therefore, aluminum impairs the body’s ability to use
stored fatty acids as an energy source by lowering L-carnitine levels in the blood^299. Low L-
carnitine causes increased waist diameter and a larger body mass index (BMI) in adults^301 ,^302. A
larger waist diameter is a negative biomarker for longevity in Nicoya (see Table 5). In the U.S.A.
for each unit of BMI over 25 there is a 6% added risk of stroke for men^303. In addition, aluminum
increases the concentration of homocysteine^1 and homocysteine is a causal factor of
atherosclerosis resulting in coronary heart disease and stroke^304 -^309.


Okinawans have low homocysteine levels in the blood as compared to westerners^99 (see Figure
10 ). This low homocysteine is in part due to the facilitation of aluminum excretion by OSA in
their drinking water. Also, this low homocysteine may account for why Okinawans have less
atherosclerotic narrowing and calcification and an 80% reduced risk for coronary heart disease
compared to westerners. An autopsy of a 100-year-old Okinawan women in 2004 revealed
normal age-associated changes in her heart. But remarkably her coronary vessels were free of
atherosclerotic narrowing and calcification^96. Autopsy reports on non-Okinawan centenarians
show coronary vessel narrowing in 66% of centenarians and coronary calcification in 84% to
97% of centenarians97,98.

Elderly Ikarians have more flexible aortas as compared to their peers on the Greek mainland^310.
This flexibility is due to less atherosclerosis that can lead to both stiffening of the aorta and an
irregular heartbeat. Because of OSA rich drinking water, elderly Ikarians have good
cardiovascular health, more flexible aortas, and 50% less heart disease than their peers on the
Greek mainland^135.

The Nicoyan advantage does not occur in females and comes primarily from lower male
cardiovascular mortality^146. In Loma Linda drinking five or more glasses of OSA rich silica
water a day was associated with a 54% less risk for men and a 41% less risk for women of a fatal
coronary heart disease event compared with Adventists who drank only two glasses or less of
OSA rich silica water a day^160.

Conclusion of Atherosclerosis - OSA in drinking water lowers the risk of coronary heart
disease^298. Aluminum exposure increases the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke^299.
Aluminum also increases homocysteine by inhibiting the production of methionine100,101. High
levels of homocysteine in the blood are a causal factor of atherosclerosis resulting in coronary
heart disease and stroke^304 -^309. Based upon data from those living in longevity regions it is clear
that high OSA levels in drinking water and food can facilitate the elimination of aluminum from
the body, prevent atherosclerosis, and lower both homocysteine levels^99 and the risk of coronary
heart disease and stroke by 4 0 to 80%97,98,135,146,160. Because fatal coronary heart disease and
stroke are the first and fifth leading causes of death in the U.S.A., lowering their risk by drinking
OSA rich water would increase both longevity and the quality of elder life in the U.S.A.


### Autism

The links between autism and aluminum accumulation in the brain were described in my 2016
book “Prevent Alzheimer’s, Autism, and Stroke”^1. Autism is a modern mismatch disease in
which our evolved mechanisms for aluminum protection are failing to protect us from an
exponential increase in environmental aluminum exposure. For this reason, we are witnessing an
epidemic of autism with the rate of autism in the population increasing exponentially since it was
first discovered by Leo Kanner in 1938 (see Figure 23 ).

Unfortunately, aluminum absorption by the brain begins early in life. Aluminum is transferred
from the maternal blood circulation to the fetal blood circulation via the placenta^311. The brains
of three fetuses, one full-term infant, and three premature infants from two to six months were
analyzed for aluminum. These brains had a mean aluminum concentration of 1.2mcg per gram
dry-weight of brain tissue with a standard deviation of 0.2mcg per gram^312. Aluminum levels
have been found to rise in the brains of fetuses during gestation and they rise the highest
immediately after birth^313. The blood-brain barrier that protects the brain is incompletely
developed at birth and is even less mature in the human embryo.

Aluminum is introduced into the bodies of children by:

- Vaccinations with vaccines containing aluminum as an adjuvant
- Intestinal absorption from food, such as baby formula, colored candy, baking powder,
    drinking water, and a variety of pharmaceuticals, such as antacids
- Absorption through the skin from antiperspirants, astringents, cosmetics, and sunscreens

Aluminum salts injected into the body by vaccination slowly leach into the blood stream^1 ,451.
Approximately 50% of children with autism have increased intestinal permeability that is not
seen in children without autism^129. After a metal ion, such as aluminum, is ingested and absorbed
by the intestine it becomes dissolved in the blood. Some of the metal is absorbed from the blood
by the brain^451. Also, an aluminum salt applied to the skin can become dissolved in the blood^446.
These routes of aluminum accumulation may be causal factors in childhood developmental
regression of a subgroup of those with autism (approximately 25%) that lose skills as they age^314.


In 2012 an analysis was performed on hair from 44 children, age 3 to 9 years, diagnosed
according to DSM-IV with ASD. It was discovered that the mean value for aluminum in the hair
of autistic children (15.2mg/kg) was 90% higher than aluminum in the hair of non-autistic
children (8.0mg/kg)^130. This was the first analytical data linking high levels of accumulated
aluminum to autism. In 2015 a second study demonstrated that aluminum levels in the hair of
autistic children are higher than aluminum levels in non-autistic children. In this study the
source of aluminum was traced to the use of aluminum cookware^315.

In 2017 an analysis was performed in Professor Christopher Exley’s laboratory on the brains of 5
individuals with confirmed ASD, 4 males and 1 female. The mean and standard deviation (in
parenthesis) of aluminum content across all five individuals for each lobe were 3.82(5.42),
2.30(2.00), 2.79(4.05) and 3.82(5.17) mcg per gram dry weight for the occipital, frontal,
temporal and parietal lobes respectively. The highest amount of aluminum detected was 8.74
mcg per dry weight in the occipital lobe of a 15-year-old boy. These are some of the highest
aluminum levels in the brain yet recorded and clearly link aluminum accumulation with the
autistic brain^65.

In the brains of those with autism it has been found that the brain regions most impacted include
the hippocampal complex and entorhinal cortex^316. These areas of the autistic brain have smaller
and less complex neuronal networks than normal^316. This suggests a curtailment of normal
neuron development and neuronal connectivity. These areas of the brain are also responsible for
memory, learning, emotion, and behavior, disturbances of which comprise the core clinical
features of autism^317. Most importantly these are the same brain regions found to be hot spots for
aluminum accumulation in the brain^266. Glial cells that comprise part of the blood-brain-barrier
were also found to be aluminum hotspots in the autistic brain^65.

In 2018 a biochemical classification of children has been found to have high (88%) reliability for
diagnosing those with ASD^318. This biochemical classification is based primarily on low levels
of metabolites from two biochemical pathways serving as biomarkers of ASD:

- Folate dependent one-carbon metabolism (FOCM)
- Transulfuration (TS)


Both of these pathways are inhibited directly and indirectly by aluminum^1 ,100,101. Therefore, low
levels of these metabolites are biomarkers for both aluminum toxicity and ASD^455. The
reliability of this biochemical classification of children is more supportive information that
aluminum accumulation is a causative factor of autism.

There has been no published study of silica water supplementation for elimination of some
symptoms of autism. However, there is reason to believe that silica water may work to lower
aluminum levels in autistic children and heal some symptoms of autism. The following is
anecdotal information from Facebook and is provided by parents who gave their children OSA
rich silica water for 3- 8 months:

1. _“_ I have become fascinated with this subject and the unbelievable simplicity of drinking a
    silicon rich mineral water to remove aluminum from the body since discovering Prof
    Chris Exley's excellent work at the end of 2017. We have been using this on our 9 yr. old
    son who has an ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) diagnosis and we saw clear cognitive
    improvements with him after 3 months on Volvic water. There were improvements to his
    mood, his laughing. He was more happy and had more speech, asking significantly more
    questions (this is MASSIVE!), and more imaginative play. _..._ After 6 months on Volvic we
    switched to Fiji for the last two months and have seen dramatic improvements. He is so
    much calmer, better memory, understanding things more, eating more things and is
    generally eating more, will sit for dinner without requiring distractions, is laughing loads
    and showing emotions more, and is making progress which his teachers and tutors are
    also seeing. It's amazing to see! We have tried almost every protocol going since he was
    3 and can confirm this is no placebo effect. This works, and is working for us and we
    hope more people try it with literally no down side. Amazing stuff! _”_ September 2018
2. _“My son is 21 and_ has autism. I started giving him Fiji water about 3 to 4 months ago. I
    didn't make him drink a certain amount or anything. He just drank it when he was thirsty,
    though he has always been a big water drinker. I didn't expect too much, but I can
    honestly say that I've noticed a difference! Mostly in the past month. I don't know how to
    explain it other than say he is more aware. Our conversations are getting to be more
    interactive. He initiated an _‘_ I love you _’_ for the first time in 21 years!!! Tonight, he said


```
‘T hank you Mom, you're the best!! ’. This is not typical for my son. Not because he didn't
feel that way, he just never expressed it verbally before. I'm not saying this to promise
other parents that you will get the same results, but I'm very grateful for what we have
experienced so far. I now buy a few cases of Fiji water a month as I truly believe it is
helping ”. July 2018
```
The following anecdotal information is from Facebook and is provided by parents who saw
improvement after giving their children silica rich water for just 6 to 8 weeks:

1. _“My daughter who is 12_ has a moderate intellectual disability diagnosis as well as
    regressive autism level 2. She also had absence seizures and non-functional speech.
    Since starting Fiji water 6 weeks ago, 1/2 liter per day, she has been pointing to people
    and objects and commenting about them or asking questions - sharing an interest - the
    beginnings of conversation (which also had disappeared as she regressed). There has
    been a major change in her auditory processing as she now hears and responds to all
    speech. She is learning, retaining, and using information. Absence seizures have
    stopped, she is making eye contact, and receptive language has improved greatly where
    she now can follow 2-3 part instructions. I have seen changes in awareness, alertness,
    connection with others, conversation, and comprehension. It was like a light switched
    on. We have started and stopped the Fiji water especially initially. Improvements eased
    a bit upon stopping the Fiji prot _ocol and picked up again upon restarting. I’ve done a_
    lot for my daughter over the years but this has been by far the easiest intervention to
    _apply with the most far reaching results across all areas for her”._ February 2018
2. _“_ My 9 year old son has really struggled with reading. All of the sudden his reading skills
    have just taken off!! To the point his teacher wanted to talk to me after school! She said
    he has improved so much in the past 2 weeks she wanted me to know how proud she was
    of him! It is amazing he has only been on the silica _water for about 6 weeks so I can’t_
    wait to see what the future holds _.”_ February 2018


3. My 6 year old son has been drinking about ½ liter a _day of Fiji and I’ve seen big_
    improvements in his behavior. Also much _more affectionate. My dad commented that it’s_
    _like he’s grown up 2 years in the last couple months._ August 2018
4. _“I have been using Fiji water for my 3.5 year old son for the last 6 weeks. He is autistic_
    and was preverbal. After starting Fiji water, there is a lot of improvement in his speech,
    understanding of language and memory. He seems to have lost a bit of his chubbiness,
    _no other negatives so far.”_ April 2018
5. _I don’t think my son would have improved this much or at all within this short timeframe_
    (8 weeks). We get little improvements every now and then, but for this amount of
    improvement it would have taken at least 2 - 3 years-worth of hard work and still
    doubtful that he would have improved this much without the silica water. It is definitely
    the silica water that is all that is different with his diet. After 3 days of drinking it, very
    subtle things started happening and after one week, there was no way I was going to stop
    the water. I too was skeptical of whether this would work as you hear so many stories and
    things to try and not much seems to do anything, but silica water should be on
    prescription for ASD kids. September 2018
6. My 16 year old son has Aspergers, he has been using 800 to 1000ml of Ascilis for about 6
    weeks with no side effects just positive changes. He was prior to starting socially
    awkward, antisocial, rather withdrawn and enjoying being alone and isolating himself in
    his room when he wasn't at school. Now he is a lot more communicative, quite enjoying
    online chats for hours with friends, chipping in family conversation, and being a lot more
    conversational and spontaneous. Initially I thought I was imagining things!! Even he says
    he feels different, clearer thinking and a bit more able to plan and remember what he's
    supposed to be doing, I have to say I am very impressed so far with the results. February
    2019
7. I have been using Fiji water for my 7 year old who is higher functioning on the spectrum
    _but used to not talk as much. Since the Fiji water, it’s been 2 months, he has been so_


```
much more aware of surroundings; talkative and more curious about what is going on
around him. Even in school his teachers have noticed a difference in speech. March 2017
```
8. _“We have been using_ Silicade. After 4 weeks my 7 year old autistic son showed no signs
    of improvement. But after 8 weeks on Silicade his hyperactivity had decreased allowing
    him to attend an entire church service. After 12 weeks he is continuing to improve, and
    I'm starting to worry that the special school section he's in may notice and kick him out! _”_

```
Note: Silicade is homemade synthetic silica water with the same level of OSA as Fiji water.
A recipe for Silicade is in Chapter 6.
```
The loss of weight (i.e., _“lost ... his chubbiness”_ ) seen in some children and adults after starting
on silica water is likely due to a rise in L-carnitine in the blood. L-Carnitine acts as a chaperone
that facilitates the transfer of stored fat as fatty acids (i.e., triglycerides) into the mitochondria so
they can be oxidized and metabolized for energy production. Both the production of L-carnitine
and the oxidation of fatty acids are suppressed by aluminum toxicity resulting in increased BMI,
as described previously in this chapter^299 -^302 ,^319.

Approximately one in five autistic children with intellectual disability and one in twelve autistic
children without intellectual disability have epileptic seizures^320. The anecdotal information that
“absence seizures have stopped” has been followed by others who have also observed more
control over seizures with silica water:

```
“My 6 year old son has epilepsy, acute confusionary migraines and autism. He has been
drinking silica water and not only are his seizures and migraines much better controlled but
he has gone from being more 2-3yr old level to almost right with his peers in most areas.
Still he is academically delayed but actually learning now, he wasn't before. ” Feb. 2018
```
This anecdotal information is encouraging and gives us hope that OSA rich drinking water
allows the brain to heal from aluminum accumulation and provides recovery from autism. Of
course, supplemental silica water is only the first step. A diet high in OSA rich vegetables (see
Chapter 4) and avoidance of aluminum ingestion (see Appendix II) are both suggested for
ultimately stopping neurodegeneration by removing aluminum from autistic children’s brains.


#### Autism Due to Vaccine Injury

Children’s body-burden of aluminum from vaccinations exceeds that from dietary sources, such
as baby formula1,3^2 1,3^22. By comparing ASD prevalence in 7 developed countries, it has been
shown that both the number of aluminum containing vaccinations and the scheduling of these
vaccinations during the first 4 months of a child’s life is strongly correlated with ASD
prevalence. Those countries, such as Sweden, Iceland, and Finland, who schedule no aluminum
containing vaccinations from birth to 3 months of age, have less than half the ASD prevalence
when compared to the U.K. and the U.S.A. where babies are given aluminum containing
vaccinations from birth to 2 months of age^323. In addition, a positive correlation was found
between autism prevalence and childhood vaccination uptake across the U.S.A. population^324.

It is estimated that aluminum accumulation due to childhood vaccination may be causal a factor
in childhood developmental regression of a subgroup of those with autism (approximately 25%)
that lose skills as they age^324. Here is anecdotal information from Facebook on how silica water
can turn around this regression due to aluminum in vaccines:

1. _“The reason I have got so interested in silica water is because of my grandbaby. He will_
    be 2 in September. We believe he is vaccine injured because he completely stopped all
    talking and jabbering after his 1 year vaccines. He has gone backwards it seems. I first
    came across diatomaceous earth, then Fiji water, and now the local silica rich spring
    water. My daughter mixes his tea and juice with the silica water. I can say without a
    doubt it has changed him. He can now look you in the eyes, but before he would not make
    any eye contact. He has started jabbering more. My daughter texted me last night saying
    _‘_ Mama it's like I have a completely different baby he is looking at me and jabbering and
    trying to say mama again _’_. So we are keeping this all up in hope's we get our little man
    back. But no more vaccines for us. She is still breastfeeding and I feel that has helped
    him a lot as well as keeping his immune system up. _”_ August 2018
2. My son, aged 9, has severe autism which he developed after vaccination. It took about 6
    months from this final vaccination for my son to go from a loving normal developed boy
    to having full blown Autism. Our boy was in fact gone, replaced by a stranger. I saw Dr.


```
Exley's report on silica water and though we might as well give it a go. ... I switched my
son to Volvic Water about 4 weeks ago, within the first week we noticed slight
improvements - good eye contact, sitting for longer, more verbal and is singing along to
more adverts, some appropriate speech, and I actually got a cuddle and a kiss from him.
... My son is currently on Day 32 of drinking silica water (Acilis main ly, sometimes
Volvic). He is currently very calm, reciting TV adverts, full of smiles, looking though his
DVDs. I plan to carry on giving my son Acilis Silica Water. At the moment we have
experienced no negatives of switching to silica water. I don’t think my son would have
improved this much or at all within this short timeframe (8 weeks). ... We get little
improvements every now and then, but for this amount of improvement it would have
taken at least 2 - 3 years-worth of hard work and still doubtful that he would have
improved this much without the silica water. It is definitely the silica water that is all that
is different with his diet. After 3 days of drinking it, very subtle things started happening
and after one week, there was no way I was going to stop the water. I too was skeptical of
whether this would work as you hear so many stories and things to try and not much
seems to do anything, but silica water should be on prescription to ASD kids. ” Sept.2018
```
I recommend that the mother drink OSA silica water when breastfeeding. It has been shown that
the mother gives almost all her silica to the baby during and immediately after pregnancy (see
Figure 8 )^85.

Look for aluminum or alum containing vaccines in Table 37 or for a more up-to-date table:
https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/appendices/b/excipient-table-2.pdf


Conclusion of Autism **–** Aluminum has been found in non-autistic brains of human fetuses, one
full-term infant, and premature infants. These brains had a mean aluminum concentration of
1.2mcg per gram dry-weight of brain tissue with a standard deviation of 0.2mcg per gram^311 ,^312
This demonstrates that aluminum from the mother’s blood is transferred to the fetal blood
circulation via the placenta and some of this aluminum normally accumulates in the fetuses’ and
infant’s brains.

Two studies have found higher than normal aluminum levels in hair samples from autistic
children. In addition, higher than normal aluminum levels (2.3 to 3.8 mcg per dry weight) have
been found in the following regions of autistic brains: occipital, frontal, temporal and parietal
lobes^65. These regions of the brain known to be hot spots for aluminum accumulation^266 are the
same areas of the brain that are responsible for memory, learning, emotion, and behavior,
disturbances that comprise the core clinical features of autism^316 ,^317. These regions of the autistic
brain have smaller and less complex neuronal networks than normal^316. Therefore, since
aluminum is a known neurotoxin, aluminum can be considered a causal factor of autism.

It is likely that aluminum accumulation due to childhood vaccination is a causal factor in
childhood developmental regression of a subgroup of those with autism (approximately 25%)
that lose skills as they age^314. Aluminum is used as an adjuvant in many of the vaccines given to
children (Table 37). Aluminum containing vaccines have been linked to an increased prevalence
of autism and seizures. OSA rich silica water taken by mother and baby has been shown to heal
autism and childhood developmental regression that is likely caused by aluminum in vaccines.

Anecdotal information suggests that a diet that includes silica rich drinking water allows the
brain to heal from aluminum accumulation and provides healing from autism. It is likely this
occurs due to OSA’s ability to facilitate the elimination of aluminum from the brain.


### Cancer

In the U.S.A. there is a 5.5-fold higher rate of breast cancer and a 7 fold higher rate of prostate
cancer than found in the Okinawan longevity region (see Table 5). Non-vegetarian Adventists
have higher risk of colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer than vegetarian Adventists (see Table
18). Could colorectal, breast, and prostate cancers be caused by aluminum accumulation and be
prevented by facilitating aluminum excretion with supplemental OSA in drinking water and
vegetable fiber in the diet?

Identical twin studies are an excellent way to access the heritable (i.e., genetic) versus
environmental risk factors of cancer. In 2000 a twin study was reported on 44,788 pairs of twins
in Sweden, Denmark, and Finland. Statistical modeling was used to estimate the relative
importance of environmental and heritable factors in causing specific types of cancer^325. The
results of this study are in Table 30.

In fact, except for certain types of rare familial cancers, such as adenomatous polyposis coli, the
contribution of hereditary factors in the etiology of most cancers is thought to be minor. This
reasoning is based upon the fact that it takes many generations for even a dominate gene to move
through a population and for this reason genetics can’t account for the dramatic growth in
incidence rates of cancers, such as colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer, in certain age groups.

From the data in Table 30 we can see that environmental factors have the primary role in causing
sporadic colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer. Since the rate of all three of these cancers is
lower in some of the longevity regions, could aluminum play a role in their etiology allowing
OSA to play a role in their prevention?


The etiology of colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer has been found to be linked to a gene that
that is called BRCA1 (note: “BRCA1 _”_ gene is in italics). When expressed, BRCA1 produces
BRCA1 mRNA that in turn produces a protein called BRCA1 (note: “BRCA1” protein is in
regular font). This BRCA1 protein is responsible for error-free repair of double-strand breaks in
DNA. When DNA is not repaired properly, there is an increased risk of cancer^109. But two
conditions can prevent the BRCA1 gene from functioning correctly and preventing BRCA1 from
acting as a tumor suppressor:

- Hereditary BRCA1 mutation in germ line cells lowers BRCA1 production107,111
- Environmental epigenetic decrease in expression of the BRCA 1 lowers BRCA1
    production^1 08,1^10

Hereditary - Since germ cells when fully developed become sperm and ovum, the BRCA1
mutations are inherited and carried for a person’s life increasing their lifetime risk of some
cancers^107. For instance, BRCA1 mutations are linked to 5-fold increased risk of colorectal
cancers in women younger than 50 years of age^167.

Environmental - Epigenetics is the modulation of gene expression by environmental chemicals,
such as aluminum, without causing mutations. Aluminum can be considered a causal factor of
colorectal, breast and prostate cancer because it epigenetically inhibits the expression of the
BRCA1gene preventing DNA repair by the BRCA1 protein^110.

As aluminum products have become more common the amount of accumulated aluminum in our
bodies has been increasing^1. With this increase in aluminum there has been an increase in
colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer in some groups of people as described in the next three
sections.

#### Colorectal Cancer

Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death among adults younger than age 50,
after breast and lung cancer in the U.S.A^326. Colorectal cancer also has the second highest


incidence rate among young adults after breast cancer in the U.S.A^326. Have colorectal cancers
been increasing among those under 50 in step with rising worldwide aluminum production? In
general, the incidence of colorectal cancer is being kept in check by periodic colonoscopy and
polypectomy in those over 5 0 years of age. But what about those under 5 0 who are in general are
not checked for polyps with colonoscopy?

In 2017 these questions were answered by a group of epidemiologists at the American Cancer
Society involved in Surveillance and Health Services Research. Rebecca L. Siegel led a study
that used age-period-cohort modeling to understand colon and rectal cancer trends from 1973 to
2013 in different age groups in the U.S.A^327 Cohorts consisted of patients who were diagnosed
with invasive colorectal cancer documented in the U.S. National Cancer Institute Surveillance,
Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program. The SEER program is the only source for
historical population-based cancer incidence in the U.S.A.

What Siegel and her group found is alarming as incident rates of both colon and rectal cancer are
dramatically increasing in those under 5 0. In fact the incidence of rectal cancer in 20 to 29 year-
olds is increasing at the rate of 2.4% a year. The data was grouped into cohorts based upon the
decade during which people with colorectal cancers were born (i.e., birth cohorts). The number
of people with these cancers was referenced as a ratio with the number of people with these
cancers in a birth cohort born in 1949 and the data for 20- 40 - year-olds is plotted in Figure 24327.


By looking at birth cohorts Seigel disentangled the changes in medical practices, such as
colonoscopies and polypectomy for those over 5 0 , from factors that vary by generation. The
data in Figure 24 clearly shows a correlation between the growth of aluminum production and
rising rates of rectal and colon cancer in the U.S.A. particularly in those 20 to 40 years of age.

The risk of colorectal cancer is increased if either there is a germ-line mutation in the BRCA1
gene^332 or the BRCA1 tumor suppression gene’s expression is reduced^107 ,108,110. For instance,
BRCA1 mutations are linked to 5-fold increased risk of colorectal cancers in women younger
than 50 years of age^167. Aluminum epigenetically lowers expression of BRCA1 resulting in
reduced levels of BRCA1 preventing BRCA1 from suppressing colorectal cancer^110

The lower rate of colon cancer in the Adventist population, as shown in Table 1 8 , maybe due to
both drinking more OSA rich silica water and eating more vegetables containing OSA^166.
Vegetables are good sources of OSA for facilitating excretion of aluminum in urine and
perspiration preventing the development of colorectal cancer. An observational study revealed
that in populations with low average intake of dietary vegetable fiber a doubling of fiber intake
will reduce the risk of colorectal cancer by 40%^328. This study involved over a half million
people aged 25 to 70 years. The study followed almost 2 million people-years of data including
1 ,065 reported cases of colorectal cancer. The only studies of OSA in drinking water reducing
the risk of colorectal cancer are those conducted on people living in the longevity regions.

#### Breast Cancer

Breast cancer has the highest cancer incidence rate in women under 40 accounting for 30 to 40%
of all cancer in females in the U.S.A.^329. Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death
among adults younger than age 50 in the U.S.A^326. Young women with breast cancer tend to
experience more aggressive disease and have lower survival rates than older women^330 ,3^31. More
aggressive breast cancer is called localized when it spreads to adjacent organs (e.g., lymph
nodes, chest wall, etc.) and is called distant when it metastases to nonadjacent organs (e.g., bone,
brain, lung, etc.).


Has breast cancer been increasing among those under 4 0 in step with rising worldwide aluminum
production? This question was answered recently by using data from the U.S. National Cancer
Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Rebecca H. Johnson
was lead author of a study that found the incidence of distant breast cancer in young women has
increased from 197 6 to 20 09 as shown in Figure 25331.

Although there appears to be a strong correlation between the rise in aluminum production and
the rise in the incidence rate of distant breast cancer, this correlation does not extend to all ages
of women and all types of breast cancer. In general, the incidence of breast cancer is not rising.
One reason for this may be better early detection of breast cancer in older women than younger
women with younger women being primarily diagnosed with more advanced disease. Another
interpretation of this data is that aluminum accumulation is both a causative factor of cancer in
breast tissue and cancer in nonadjacent “distant” organs. This interpretation requires that
aluminum promotes both tumorigenesis and metastasis in mammary gland cells. This has been
shown to be the case as aluminum chloride at levels measured in human breast tissue
promotes tumorigenesis and metastasis in mammary gland epithelial cells from mice^458.

The risk of breast cancer is increased if either there is a germ-line mutation in the BRCA1 gene^332
or the BRCA1 tumor suppression gene’s expression is reduced^107. For instance, at age 50 the risk


of breast cancer is increased by 28.5% for carriers of a mutated BRCA1 gene versus those who
are non-carriers^332. More importantly aluminum epigenetically lowers expression of BRCA1
resulting in reduced levels of BRCA1 preventing BRCA1 from suppressing breast cancer^110. The
aluminum salts used in antiperspirants, such as aluminum chloride and aluminum chlorohydrate,
were shown to compromise DNA repair systems by reducing levels of BRCA1 mRNA in human
breast epithelial cells^110. BRCA1 mRNA is required for BRCA1 protein production.

The aluminum salts used in antiperspirants were also shown to cause double strand DNA
breaks^110. These breaks in the DNA also compromise DNA repair systems and increase the risk
of breast cancer. It is therefore not surprising that the use of aluminum containing
underarm products, particularly starting under 30 years of age, is both significantly
associated with increased risk of breast cancer and increased aluminum levels in breast
tissue versus age-matched controls in a study of women with and without breast cancer^459.

#### Prostate Cancer

The prostate is a gland in the male reproductive system and it is estimated that there will be
approximately 165,000 new cases of prostate cancer in the U.S.A. during 2018^333. About 99% of
prostate cancer occurs in males over 50 years of age^334. Prostate cancer accounts for 19% of male
cancers and 9% of deaths in males due to cancer^333. The incidence of prostate cancer is
increasing worldwide. The incidence of prostate cancer increased in 32 of 40 countries examined
during the decade 2000 to 2010^335.

The incidence of prostate cancer has been studied in Canada. Currently the age group in Canada
with the highest rate of prostate cancer incidence is the 65 - to- 69 - year-olds. When the incidence
rate of prostate cancer in this age group is plotted against worldwide aluminum production there
is a strong correlation with both having risen 4 - fold between 1970 and 2010 (see Figure 26 )^336.


The risk of prostate cancer is increased if either there is a germ-line mutation in the BRCA1
gene^332 or the BRCA1 tumor suppression gene’s expression is reduced^107. For instance, at age 70
the risk of prostate cancer is increased 12% for carriers of a mutated BRCA1 gene versus those
who are non-carriers^332. More importantly the risk of prostate cancer is significantly increased if
the BRCA1 tumor suppression gene’s expression is reduced^107. The BRCA1 gene modulates
proliferation, repair of DNA strand breaks, and expression of key cellular regulatory proteins in
human prostate cancer cells. These activities are consistent with BRCA1 acting as a prostate
cancer suppressor^111. Aluminum epigenetically lowers expression of BRCA1 preventing BRCA1
from suppressing prostate cancer^110.

Conclusion of Cancer - In the U.S.A. there is a 5.5-fold higher rate of breast cancer and a 7 fold
higher rate of prostate cancer than those living in the Okinawan longevity region (see Table 5).
Non-vegetarian Adventists in the U.S.A. have higher risk of colorectal, breast, and prostate
cancer than vegetarian Adventists (see Table 18). A study of identical twins has shown that
environmental factors account for over half the risk of having these cancers. Aluminum
accumulation is likely an environmental causal factor in colorectal, breast, and prostate cancers.
As shown in the longevity regions of Okinawa and Loma Linda these cancers can be prevented
by facilitating aluminum excretion by drinking OSA rich silica water and eating a high OSA rich

### vegetable fiber diet.


### Conception

Three meta-analyses have found that men from Western countries, such as the U.S.A., have
declining male reproductive health^337 -^339. One measure of reproductive health is sperm
concentration in semen expressed as millions of sperm per cubic centimeter (a.k.a. cc). In 1998
Elisabeth Carlsen, et al., reviewed 61 studies (28 from the U.S.A.) on semen quality in men
without a history of infertility^337. The publications reviewed had studied 14,947 men between
1938 and 1991. Carlsen concluded there had been a genuine decline in semen quality over the
previous 50-year period. Neils Jorgensen and Elisabeth Carlsen, et al., also published a paper in
2006 on semen quality in men from the Nordic-Baltic area of Europe^338. Carlsen’s data covering
the 50-year period 1950 to 2000 is plotted in Figure 27. Carlson’s conclusion has remained
controversial until a more recent meta-analysis was published in 2017. This recent meta-analysis
reviewed 185 studies on semen quality of 42,935 men and concluded from 1973 to 2011 the total
sperm concentration in semen has declined 52.4% at a rate of 1.4% a year^339.

Sperm concentrations in semen below 40 million per cc have been shown to lower fertility^340.
The graph in Figure 27 shows an approximate three-fold increase from 19 6 0 to 2000 in number
of men with semen concentrations of less than 40 million sperm per cc of semen. This graph also
shows the four-fold increase in world-wide aluminum production during this same time period.


Spermatogenesis is the process by which sperm are produced by the testis. Aluminum has been
found to inhibit spermatogenesis in rats and voles^341 -^343. In the case of rats the aluminum was
administered orally at human dietary levels for just 60 days^341. In 2014 aluminum was found in
human semen at a mean concentration of 339mcg per liter with some patients having over
500mcg per liter. Patients with high sperm count had low levels of aluminum in their semen
while patients with low sperm count were found to have higher levels of aluminum in their
semen^344. This was the first solid evidence that aluminum not only inhibits spermatogenesis in
some mammals but also inhibits spermatogenesis in humans and is likely a causal factor in the
decline of worldwide male fertility.

Sperm motility (i.e., mobility) is required for fertilization. In 2016 aluminum was found to
inhibit human sperm motility^345. There is evidence that aluminum lowers sperm motility by
facilitating higher levels of reactive oxygen species (a.k.a. ROS) in the sperm^345.

Conclusion of Conception - The rise in worldwide production of aluminum is in synchrony with
the rise in worldwide male infertility (see Figure 27 ). Aluminum has been found in human semen
and higher concentrations are correlated with greater infertility^344. Also, aluminum has been
found to negatively impact spermatogenesis in other mammals (e.g., rats and voles)^341 -^343.
Finally, aluminum also lowers human sperm motility that is required for fertilization^345. It is
clear that aluminum is likely a causal factor of rising worldwide male infertility.

There have been no published studies of OSA rich water increasing male fertility by facilitating
the excretion of aluminum. But hopefully these studies will be funded and published in the near
future.


### Multiple Sclerosis

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating disease in which demyelination of nerve cell axons
occurs in the central nervous system (e.g., spinal cord and brain). Myelin sheaths on nerve cell
axons electrically insulate the axons allowing them to very quickly transfer impulses.
Oligodendrocytes are a type of glial cells that create myelin sheaths. Environmental chemicals
that disrupt the biochemistry of oligodendrocytes will cause inflammatory demyelination lesions
on axons, interference of axonal nerve conduction, and ultimately multiple sclerosis with a range
of symptoms including physical, mental, and sometimes psychiatric problems. Cognitive
impairment occurs in up to 65 percent of those with MS^346. The specific symptoms of MS
depend upon the location of the inflammatory lesions in the nervous system. MS is triggered by
both environmental and genetic factors that increase the individual’s risk of MS^347.

MS was first described in 1868 by Jean-Martin Charcot^348. Approximately 2.3 million people
worldwide were affected by MS in 2015 and 18,900 people died of MS worldwide in 2015
compared with 12,000 people in 1990^349. MS is usually diagnosed between 20 to 50 years of age
being most commonly diagnosed at age 30. Twelve twin pairs with identical genetics (i.e.,
monozygotic) were given a firm clinical diagnosis of MS in one or both twins. In 6 twin pairs
only one twin had MS and in the other 6 twin pairs both twins had MS^350. This suggests that the
causes of MS include both environmental and genetic factors.

In 1980 the prevalence of MS was shown to have a strong dependence on the latitude at which
people were living^351. The number of deaths per year due to MS is a good indication of the
prevalence of MS and this is shown globally in Figure 28349. Migration studies indicated that
adult migrants generally retained the MS risk of their birthplace. However, it was found that
those migrating under 15 years of age by moving either closer of further from the equator
acquired the risk of their new residence^351. A review in 2008 revealed that in the previous 30
years the MS incidence was both less dependent upon latitude and from 1955 to 2008 the female
MS to male MS ratio had increased during this period from 1.4 to 2.3^352.


The latitude dependence of MS is similar to that of autism in that both diseases are found at
lower prevalence in the tropics^351 ,3^53. Since the production of vitamin D3 in the body requires
sunlight and there is more sunlight per day in the tropics, it has been theorized that vitamin D 3
may play a role in preventing autism and possibly MS^354. This role could be due to vitamin D’s
facilitation of aluminum elimination by the kidneys, even in children with chronic kidneys
damage^355.

Although multiple sclerosis and autism have the same latitudinal dependence, the female to male
ratio of those diagnosed with MS is the inverse of that observed in autism. It is known that young
boys absorb more aluminum than young girls possibly accounting for why there are 4 times more
boys than girls who are diagnosed with autism^128 ,129. However, MS is a disease of women and
men not young girls and boys. Women who are pregnant have almost no silica in their blood
making them more likely to accumulate aluminum (see Figure 8 )^85. It is known that women who
have unrecognized MS will start having MS symptoms during pregnancy or after delivery when
they have almost no silica in their blood^356. Also, up to 40% of women with relapsing-remitting
MS will have a relapse after pregnancy^357. This data agrees with the hypothesis that low silica in
the blood during pregnancy results in more aluminum accumulation and MS symptoms in
women.


The incidence rate of MS is rising at a rate faster than accounted for by either a genetic mutation
moving through the population or improved testing for MS^358. Three studies have been
published that examined the temporal variation in MS incidence rates and the female to male MS
ratio and the data is presented in Table 31 and Figure 29359 -^361.

All three of these areas of the world have seen a dramatic increase in MS incidence in the last 20
to 30 years. Note that S.E. Wales is furthest from the equator and it does have both a slightly
higher MS incidence rate and a higher female to male ratio than the other two locations.


In the thirty-year period from 1975 to 2005 the MS incidence rate of both S.E. Wales and
Newcastle Australia increased three-fold^359 ,^360. During this same period worldwide aluminum
production also increased three-fold. This rise in aluminum production has resulted in higher
aluminum ingestion due to aluminum being added to drinking water, food, kitchen ware, drugs,
vaccines, colored candy, and even inhaled air. These products increase both aluminum ingestion
and aluminum accumulation in our bodies.

Multiple sclerosis is a demyelinating disease and myelin is made by cells called
oligodendrocytes. Aluminum negatively impacts myelin production by promoting the
peroxidation of myelin in oligodendrocytes^363 ,3^64. Transferrin is a molecular iron transporter
required by the body to move iron across the blood-brain-barrier. Aluminum can mimic iron due
to similar size and ionic charge. Therefore, aluminum can be transported into oligodendrocytes
by transferrin. When aluminum complexed with transferrin is incubated with oligodendrocytes
there is a 3-to- 4 - fold increase in aluminum inside oligodendrocytes^362.

Myelin is the preferential target of aluminum-mediated oxidative damage^363 ,3^64. This oxidation
occurs due to aluminum ions being transported by transferrin into glial cells, specifically
oligodendrocytes^364. Aluminum ions act as physiological stressors by stimulating brain cells to
produce oxidizing chemicals (a.k.a. ROS) that cause inflammation in the brain219,36^5 ,36^6. Table 32
shows how much ROS is produced from a cell culture of human glial cells exposed to 50nM
aqueous solutions of various common metal ions^219.


As shown in Table 32 aluminum tops the list of metal ion inducers of reactive oxygen species
(ROS) in human glial cells, like oligodendrocytes. Aluminum at very low concentration (i.e.,
nanomolar) has also been shown to induce pro-inflammatory gene expression in human brain
cells^366. The accumulation of aluminum in oligodendrocytes causing inflammatory lesions is a
likely causal factor of MS.

Chris Exley’s group at Keele University has shown that people with MS have a higher-than-
normal body burden of aluminum. They have also shown that OSA rich drinking water facilitates
aluminum elimination in those with MS. The median daily aluminum excretion in the urine of
people with relapsing-remitting and secondary progressive MS is 7.4 and 2.6 times higher,
respectively, than people without MS^367. The amount of aluminum excreted by those with
relapsing–remitting MS was twice as high as people suffering aluminum intoxication. The
median aluminum excretion in the urine of 14 out of 15 people with MS was found to 2.5-fold
higher when drinking up to 1.5 liters of silica-rich water (35ppm OSA) per day with women
excreting more aluminum than men^368. Therefore, people with MS absorb and accumulate more
aluminum than normal and silica water facilitates aluminum elimination in those with MS.

But do people with MS accumulate more aluminum in their brains than normal? This question
was recently answered by Chris Exley’s group at Keele University^369 ,488. They analyzed brain
tissue for aluminum from 14 donors with a diagnosis of MS and 12 donors without an MS
diagnosis. They found that the aluminum content of brain tissue in those with MS was
“universally high” with many tissues bearing concentrations in excess of 10mcg/gram dry weight
and some exceeding 50mcg/gram dry weight^369. Aluminum in the brains of those without MS
was universally low with the majority of measurements below 1mcg/gram dry weight^488.
Aluminum specific staining showed aluminum both inside and outside of cells^369.

These results indicate that people with MS have a higher body-burden of aluminum than
normal and some of that aluminum is in their brains at much higher-than-normal levels.
Drinking silica-rich water facilitates the elimination of aluminum and possibly ultimately
lowers the frequency of relapsing or slows the progression of MS.


There is limited anecdotal information available regarding OSA treatment for MS. But in 2014 a
book was published titled the “The Wahls Protocol” written by Dr. Terry Wahls, M.D.^454. Dr.
Wahls was diagnosed with MS eventually requiring a wheelchair. But then miraculously she
healed herself. She can now ride her bike as much as 18 miles in a day. This brings to my mind
the biblical phrase: “Physician heal thyself” (Luke 4:23 King James Version). She changed her
diet and a number of lifestyle choices that both increased OSA ingestion and decreased
aluminum ingestion and accumulation for example:

- Consumed at least 6- 9 cups of vegetables a day – Increases OSA ingestion (see Table 23)
- Consumed much more vegetables than fruit – Increases OSA ingestion (see Table 23)
- Added fermented vegetables to the diet – Increases OSA ingestion
- Reduced protein in the diet – Increases OSA ingestion due to substituting vegetables
- Switched to stainless steel and cast-iron cookware – Lowers aluminum ingestion
- Used sauna 4 times a week – Facilitates aluminum elimination that is enhanced with OSA
- Performed daily aerobic exercise – Increases hippocampal volume and produces more
    neuropeptide YY (a.k.a. PYY) that lowers aluminum absorption and accumulation^1.

#### MS Due to Vaccine Injury

The human papilloma vaccine (a.k.a. HPV, Gardasil) contains aluminum as an adjuvant and is
given as a series of vaccinations to people aged 9 to 44. The HPV vaccine is primarily given to
people at an age when they have the highest risk of MS.

In 2015 a Scandinavian study of 4 million girls and women age 10 to 44, of whom 800,000 were
given the HPV vaccination, reported no statistically significant increased risk of MS^370. Of the 4
million eligible for the study 5,553 individuals were excluded “because of prevalent multiple
sclerosis” and 4,322 individuals were first diagnosed with MS during the study. However, of the
800,000 who received the HPV vaccination only 73 were diagnosed with MS during a 2-year
period following HPV vaccination. However, 30 - to- 44 - year-olds who were given the HPV
vaccine were shown to have a slightly increased risk of MS diagnosis within 2 years of
vaccination compared to those who did not receive the vaccine (40/100,000 versus 30/100,000).


The Scandinavian study did not evaluate the risk of a relapse of MS symptoms due to the HPV
vaccine in those 5,553 people who were excluded “because of prevalent multiple sclerosis”.
These 5,553 girls and women are most likely to be both aluminum absorbers and negatively
impacted by HPV vaccination. For instance, relapse of MS symptoms, for those diagnosed with
relapsing-remitting MS, is likely triggered by either high levels of aluminum and/or low levels of
silica in their blood. A study is needed to evaluate the risk of relapse after vaccination with an
aluminum containing vaccine in those people diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS. Currently
the MS Trust in the U.K. recommends, if you are experiencing a relapse affecting your ability to
carry out daily living activities, delay vaccination until your symptoms are resolved.

In 2018 in Miami, Florida two teens, one male and one female, who were 14 and 17 years of age
experienced symptoms of MS within 1 to 2 weeks of vaccination with HPV vaccine^371. They
both were diagnosed with optic neuritis and had symptoms of blurred vision and in one case
numbness and weakness in the legs. Oliogoclonal bands (i.e., bands of immunoglobulins) were
found in their cerebrospinal fluid but not their blood serum indicating inflammation of the central
nervous system that is indicative of MS. Both teens experienced a relapse of symptoms within 2
months of initial symptoms and were both diagnosed with relapsing–remitting MS^371.

MS is a disease with “obscure symptoms”^371. Therefore, MS may fail to be correctly diagnosed
in all cases. In the following anecdotal information from Facebook we may have an example of
undiagnosed relapsing-remitting MS. Possibly due to both childhood vaccinations with
aluminum containing vaccines and a diet of junk food and healed by drinking silica water and
avoiding junk food:

```
“My son has always been healthy, and I cannot remember a time where he has needed to
go to the doctor in all of his 10 years. But at age 10 he went from healthy to wheelchair
bound in the space of 6 months. First he had blurred vision and I noticed he was walking
too close to walls and hedges, almost walking into them. Then he had chronic weakness
in his legs and would fall over, unable to move his legs. He was tested and they found
nothing wrong, believing it must be a mental problem. After all these tests he remained
undiagnosed, untreated, and continued to deteriorate physically and mentally. I
researched and followed Chris Exley's advice, giving my son Volvic silica water each
```

```
day. We noticed a difference within 3 days, he was out of the wheelchair within 10 days,
and doing PE and gymnastics at school in 45 days. A relapse of symptoms happened
recently. Unfortunately when my son strays off the healthy food and eats junk food over a
certain amount of time, his symptoms reappear. Doctors don't want to admit that they
failed and a daily bottle of silica water cured him. He has been on Volvic water since
November 2016. This is something we will do for as long as we can. It is not a quick fix
and needs to be a lifestyle change. Sorry to say it, the health system failed us, but Prof
Exley's research saved our son. It sounds too simple to be true, but it worked
unquestionably for us.” August 2018
```
Note that the symptoms in this anecdotal case (i.e., blurred vision, weakness in the legs, relapse
of symptoms) are identical to those observed recently in Florida after HPV vaccination. These
are likely examples of aluminum in vaccines and/or aluminum in junk food triggering MS or a
relapse of MS symptoms. For more information on aluminum containing junk food to avoid and
vaccines that contain aluminum see Appendix II and III.

Conclusion of Multiple Sclerosis - MS is a demyelinating disease that slows nerve impulses on
nerve cell axons. The myelin that coats the outside of axons and associated glial cells (e.g.,
oligodendrocytes) that make myelin are targets for aluminum accumulation and toxicity^363 -^364. In
several areas of the world the incidence of MS is rising at the same rate as world-wide aluminum
production^227 - 229,^359 -^361. Aluminum ions are known to damage glial cells by stimulating the
production of reactive oxygen species (ROS)^365. ROS induced inflammation of glial cells results
in inflammatory lesions that are characteristic of MS^347.

Compared with those without MS, people with relapsing-remitting MS have 7-fold more
aluminum and people with secondary progressive MS have 2. 6 - fold more aluminum in their
urine on average^367. Also, people with MS have much higher than normal concentrations of
accumulated aluminum in their brains^369 ,488. Silica-rich drinking water has been shown to
increase aluminum excretion in the urine by 2.5-fold in those with MS^368.

Further research is needed to find if a steady diet of silica-rich drinking water and/or OSA
rich vegetables will lower the frequency of relapsing or the slow the progression of MS.


### Osteoporosis – Low Bone Mass

Osteoporosis is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the elderly and has been called
the “silent epidemic of the 21st century”^86. Clinically osteoporosis increases the incidence of
bone fractures of the femur, vertebrae, radius, and hip. These fractures in the elderly rapidly lead
to a series of events that can result in death. These events include pain, disability, and loss of
independence.

People living in the Okinawan longevity region have 20% fewer hip fractures than do mainland
Japanese and about 40% fewer hip fractures than Americans^113. The rate of bone mineral density
(BMD) loss was compared between Okinawans and mainland Japanese. It was discovered that
for women older than 40 and men older than 50, mainland Japanese lose more calcium from their
bones than Okinawans^114. OSA supplementation has been shown to improve BMD by both
inhibiting bone mass loss and stimulating bone formation in humans^86 -^88 and rats^115 -^117.
Therefore, high bone density in older Okinawans is most likely due to high levels of OSA in
their drinking water.

Bone Remodeling - Just like homes being remodeled, our bones are continuously being
remodeled for optimal strength. Two teams of cells (i.e., osteoclasts and osteoblasts) are at work
to adapt our bones keeping them strong enough to support the load we place on them without
breaking:

- The demolition team – Osteoclasts remove calcium weakening bones & lowering BMD
- The rebuilding team – Osteoblasts add calcium strengthening bones & increasing BMD

The rebuilding team (i.e., osteoblasts) is stimulated by load bearing exercise and the sex
hormones (i.e., estrogen and testosterone) and inhibited by aluminum accumulation. Women
over 40 and men over 50 have declining sex hormone production and therefore have more bone
demolition than rebuilding causing progressively lower BMD. In addition, as we get older we
have progressively lower blood OSA levels and accumulate aluminum at a higher rate inhibiting
bone rebuilding causing progressively lower BMD.


Aluminum Inhibits Bone Remodeling - Aluminum ions inhibit the deposition of calcium in
bones. In humans with elevated aluminum due to dialysis it was observed that the aluminum
causes softening of the bones (a.k.a. osteomalacia) by inhibiting mineralization and lowering
both osteoclast and osteoblast numbers^372. The uptake of calcium by the femur of calcium
deficient rats was observed to be 43% less when the rats were fed 0.25% supplemental aluminum
chloride versus rats fed no supplemental aluminum chloride^373. Aluminum citrate was observed
to inhibit chicken bone remodeling by slowing bone calcification by osteoblasts and increasing
calcium loss from bones independent of osteoclasts^374. In vitro mouse bone formation was
slowed by aluminum ions inhibiting calcium uptake by the bone^375. These results indicate that
ionic aluminum exposure inhibits bone remodeling resulting in lower BMD and weaker bones.

#### OSA Removes Aluminum and Increases Bone Mineral Density

consumption of silicon is associated with increased BMD in animals, including humans, while
silicon deficiency is associated with reduced BMD^87. Studies have shown that supplemental
OSA in drinking water stops the loss of BMD in the femur and tibia (i.e., upper and lower leg
bones) by reducing bone demolition by osteoclasts (i.e., bone resorption)^115 -^117. In addition,
supplemental OSA stimulates osteoblast cells to rebuild bones^88. Therefore, drinking silica rich
mineral water will facilitate aluminum elimination, bone remodeling, increased BMD, and
stronger bones.

#### Conclusion of Osteoporosis – Low Bone Mass

region have 40% less hip fractures than people in the U.S.A. This is most likely due to higher
levels of OSA in the Okinawan drinking water. Increased dietary consumption of dietary OSA
in drinking water and OSA rich vegetables have been found to stop the loss of bone mineral
density (BMD). OSA facilitates the elimination of aluminum and thereby enhances bone
remodeling, increasing bone rebuilding, slowing bone demolition, and making bones stronger.


### Parkinson’s Disease

The recent announcement that Alan Alda has been diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease (PD)
sparked my interest in writing this section. Recent papers on the rapidly rising incidence of PD
and a link between PD and traumatic brain injury make it clear that we need to know more^376 -^378.

PD is a neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system that negatively impacts regions
of the brain that control movement (i.e., motor system). The main motor symptoms are called
“parkinsonism” and the most obvious are tremor, rigidity, and the impairment of the power of
voluntary movement (a.k.a. akinesia). PD generally occurs in people over 70 but in 5-10% of
cases does occur in people under 50, where it is called “young-onset PD”. PD is the second most
common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer’s and PD is also a terminal disease. The
motor symptoms of the disease are due to dopaminergic cell death in the substantia nigra (SN)
region of the midbrain leaving this region deficient in the neurotransmitter dopamine.

The cause of PD is believed to be a combination of environmental and genetic factors.
Aluminum is an environmental factor whose prevalence is increasing at approximately the same
rate as the rising prevalence of PD. For instance, worldwide death from PD increased 2.3-fold
between 1990 and 201 3 while worldwide aluminum production increased 2.8 fold in this same
period^229 ,3^76. In the U.S.A. the incidence rate of PD is also increasing at a rate comparable to that
of worldwide aluminum production as graphed in Figure 30377.


Traumatic brain injury (a.k.a. TBI) has been found to significantly increase the risk of PD in
later life. Records of 325,870 health care recipients of the U.S. Veterans Health Administration
were studied. These records were age-matched 1:1 to a random sample of those with and
without a diagnosis of mild to moderately-severe TBI. Those with mild TBI had 71% higher risk
of PD than normal while those with moderate-severe TBI had 83% higher risk than normal of
PD^378. As explained earlier in this chapter both TBI and aluminum increase the permeability of
the blood-brain-barrier opening the door to environmental chemicals, such as aluminum, entering
the brain^214 -^218. Aluminum and iron concentrations have been found to be higher in the SN
region of the brain in people with PD as compared to people without PD^379 -^381.

Divalent Metal Ion Transporter (DMT1) is an iron transporter protein that transports essential
iron to neurons in the SN region of the brain. Because iron and aluminum are approximately the
same atomic size and can have the same electronic charge, DMT1 also transports aluminum that
causes neurodegeneration in the SN region of the brain^382. The amount of DMT1 being made
(i.e., DMT1 genetic expression) is not governed by iron availability; but instead governed by a
person’s age and the brain location to which the iron is being transported^383. For instance, DMT1
is increased for iron transport to the SN region as people age and is increased in the brains of
Parkinson’s patients^383 ,3^84. The result is that as we age higher DMT1 expression in nigral
dopaminergic neurons facilitates higher iron and aluminum levels in the SN region dependent
only upon the availability of absorbed iron and aluminum^383 ,3^84.

Aluminum alters the metabolism of levodopa (a.k.a. L-DOPA) by increasing the ratio of
dihydroxy-indole (DHI) to dihydoxy-indole carboxylate (DHICA) in SN regions that are slightly
acidic (i.e., pH 5.5)^385. A high ratio of DHI to DHICA inhibits the polymerization of a mixture
of DHI and DHICA to neuromelanin (NM)^386. Less NM means less protection from oxidative
stress. Aluminum causes more oxidative stress (i.e., ROS) in the brain than any other common
metal ion (see Table 32)^219. Aluminum enhances both oxidative stress and dopaminergic
neurodegeneration as has been observed in an experimental animal model of PD^387. In the brains
of patients with PD, oxidative stress leading to dopaminergic cell death is indicated by lower-
than-normal levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) levels being found in the SN region^388.


Neuromelanin (NM) stores iron and can also store aluminum in neurons of the SN region. It is
believed that iron and any aluminum stored in NM is less likely to cause oxidative stress and cell
death in the SN region^389. Normally NM slowly increases in concentration in neurons of the SN
region from birth to age 90+^390. However, patients with PD have only 50% of normal levels of
NM, possibly due to aluminum causing a high DHI to DHCA ratio that inhibits the creation of
NM^386 ,3^91. This is a dangerous situation because people with a damaged-blood-brain-barrier217,218
and all people over 77 years of age absorb and accumulate more aluminum than normal^194. For
this reason, accumulating aluminum that is unable to be stored by available NM, creates
oxidative stress and dopamergic cell death in the SN region of PD patients^387. Worse yet is when
these cells die, a storm of NM stored iron and aluminum is released creating even more
inflammation in the SN region of the brain^389.

**Conclusion of Parkinson’s Disease –** Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder
of the substantia nigra (SN) region of the brain that is due to both environmental and genetic
factors. The following evidence points to aluminum accumulation being a causal factor of PD:

- The incidence rate of PD is correlated with increasing worldwide aluminum production.
- Blood-brain-barrier damage due to TBI and/or aluminum increases the risk of both PD
    and aluminum accumulation
- Divalent Metal Ion Transporter (DMT1) genetic expression is increased resulting in the
    transport of too much aluminum and iron to the brain’s SN region as people age
- Aluminum levels are higher in the SN region of the brain in people with PD as compared
    to people without PD
- Aluminum alters the metabolism of levodopa resulting in the inhibition of neuromelanin
    (NM) production and ultimately lowering NM levels by 50% in the SN region of PD
    patients allowing aluminum to cause oxidative damage to the SN region
- Lower than normal levels of GSH indicate oxidative damage to the SN region


Research on the etiology of PD has uncovered four causal factors:

- Traumatic brain injury (TBI) - Damages the blood-brain-barrier allowing
    environmental chemicals, such as aluminum, to accumulate in the brain
- Divalent Metal Ion Transporter (DMT1) Expression - is not governed by iron
    availability; but instead governed by a person’s age and the brain location. DMT1
    transports too much aluminum and iron to the brain’s SN region in older people
- Aluminum **–** Damages the blood-brain barrier by decreasing expression of F-actin and
    occludin, generates ROS in human glial cells, alters metabolism of levodopa resulting in
    less neuromelanin, more oxidative damage and neurodegeneration in the SN region
- Neuromelanin (NM) **–** sequesters aluminum and iron protecting the brain from oxidative
    stress due to these metals. But people with PD have 50% less NM than normal

By drinking OSA and taking several drugs, PD can be both prevented and possibly healed:

- Drink OSA rich water **–** facilitates removal of aluminum preventing further damage to
    the blood brain barrier and oxidative stress, neuro-inflammation, and neurodegeneration
    in the SN region of the midbrain.
- Non-aspirin and Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) **–** NSAIDs
    decrease neuro-inflammation and reduce the incidence of PD by greater than 20% for
    long-term and regular users^393.
- Levodopa - L-DOPA combined with DOPA decarboxylase and COMT inhibitors is the
    recommended treatment for PD as they provide palliative relief from the symptoms of
    PD. Aluminum inhibits L-DOPA activation of homocysteine methylation by methionine
    synthase resulting in increased homocysteine in those with PD100,381. Therefore, OSA rich
    water is recommended in order to lower both aluminum accumulation and homocysteine.

### Preventing Alzheimer’s Disease in Those with Down Syndrome..........................................................

Children with Down syndrome have delayed growth, characteristic physical traits, and mild to
moderate intellectual disability. Down syndrome (a.k.a. trisomy 21) is a genetic disorder
involving the presence of all or part of a third copy of chromosome 21^394. The extra chromosome
occurs by chance with the parents of a Down child being genetically normal. The possibility of
giving birth to a Down child is 0.1% in mothers 20 years old and 3% in mothers 45 years old.
Currently there is no known environmental factor that changes these percentages.

Environmental factors do lead to earlier onset of AD in those with Down syndrome. There is a
six-fold increased gastrointestinal absorption of aluminum in individuals with Down
syndrome^395. This is likely why 90% of those with Down syndrome over 30 years of age have
similar neuropathology to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients and at least 70% will develop
dementia by age 55 to 60 years^395 ,3^96.

In general, as they age, people absorb and accumulate aluminum at different rates accounting for
why some get AD earlier than others77,3^97. On average people under 77 years of age diagnosed
with AD have a 64% greater gastrointestinal aluminum absorption rate than age-matched people
without AD^398 ,3^99. But on average all people over 77 years of age, with and without AD, have
similar high rates of gastrointestinal aluminum absorption^400. The major difference between AD
patients with and without Down syndrome is an earlier onset of both gastrointestinal aluminum
absorption and AD neuropathology in those with Down syndrome^401.

#### Conclusion of Preventing Alzheimer’s in those with Down Syndrome

cause Down syndrome but aluminum absorption is six-fold greater in individuals with Down
syndrome than normal. This high level of aluminum absorption increases the risk of
Alzheimer’s in those with Downs resulting in 70% of those with Down syndrome developing
dementia by age 55 to 60 years of age. In order to prevent Alzheimer’s it is recommended that
those with Down syndrome take a daily OSA rich silica water supplement. In addition, a diet
high in silica rich vegetables and grains is recommended.


### Seizures

Epilepsy is a condition in which seizures occur on a repeated basis. Seizures occur in the brain
when too many nerve cells “fire” too quickly creating what has been referred to as an “electrical
storm”. There are over 40 different types of seizures. Symptoms can either include convulsions,
such as in tonic-clonic (a.k.a. grand mal) seizures, or no convulsions, such as in absence (a.k.a.
petit mal) seizures. Other symptoms of seizures include: confusion, fainting, blackouts, blank
staring, sudden and unexplained falls, episodes of blinking and chewing at inappropriate times.

The highest incidence rates of epilepsy have been reported in both the very young, particularly in
the first few years of life, and the very old^402. Currently the worldwide annual incidence rate of
epilepsy is 68 per 100,000 people and in the U.S.A. the annual incidence rate is 35.5-38.6 per
100,000 people^403. The Epilepsy Foundation estimates there are 326,000 children in the U.S.A.
who have been diagnosed with epilepsy making it the 4th most prevalent neurological disease.
Epilepsy not only lowers the quality of life of those who suffer its symptoms but also has a
negative impact on their longevity. Two recent studies in Nova Scotia and the Netherlands have
found that children with epilepsy are 5 to 9 times more likely to die than healthy children^404 ,^405.

It is well known that aluminum causes seizures in monkeys. In 1954 it was reported that three
months after aluminum hydroxide is injected in the brains of rhesus (macaca mulatta) monkeys,
chronic epileptic seizures are observed in the monkeys that by EEG correlate with those in
humans^406. In 1978 chronic temporal lobe seizures were induced in 11 monkeys with bilateral
implantation of aluminum hydroxide in their hippocampi^407. The hippocampus is a known
hotspot for aluminum accumulation in humans^266. In 1982 chronic absence seizures (a.k.a. petit
mal epilepsy) were induced in juvenile rhesus monkeys with bilateral implantation of aluminum
hydroxide in their thalami^408. Aluminum induced chronic epileptic seizures in monkeys have
been shown to spontaneously continue for at least 7 years^409.

It is also well known that aluminum causes seizures in humans. Aluminum encephalopathy is a
neurological condition due to aluminum accumulation in the brain usually occurring in humans
undergoing regular dialysis treatment^410. Epileptic seizures are observed in 57% of those


diagnosed with aluminum encephalopathy^411. Dialysis-associated seizures were seen in 7.2% of
180 children and adolescents on regular dialysis treatment^410. Seizures have also been observed
after 6 months of occupational exposure to aluminum and 36 to 42 days after the use of
aluminum containing bone cement during brain surgery^413 ,4^14. Serum aluminum concentration is
normally less than 1mcg/L but in the cases of exposure to aluminum containing bone cement it
was 4.4 to 4.3mcg/L^413 ,^414. High serum aluminum levels are a predisposing condition for
epileptic seizures^476. A person who drank water containing high levels of aluminum sulfate
developed late-onset epilepsy and died of asphyxiation associated with an epileptic fit. Autopsy
and analysis of their hippocampus revealed very high levels of aluminum (4.35 mcg/g dry
weight)^477.

It has been reported that regular injections of an aluminum chelator (i.e., DFO a.k.a.
desferoxamine) concomitantly lowered serum aluminum levels and abolished epileptic
seizures^478. Does supplemental OSA stop seizures by removing accumulated aluminum from the
body? This question has been answered recently by a group of parents of children with seizures
who had their children drink OSA rich silica water. The following anecdotal data from
Facebook strongly suggests that routine OSA supplementation can in some cases stop seizures in
children:

1. _“We started drinking Fiji water in January. It is now July and my child has been_
    _myoclonic jerk free since February. Honestly didn’t think Fiji water was a factor so_
    we stopped Fiji for two weeks just to see. Some jerks returned so we started it back
    _up and so far none. We are sticking with Fiji”._ July 2018
2. _“I have a similar story to yours. My 5 year old is still seizure free after starting on_
    Fiji water. The last seizure was in November. I am not going to lie - sometimes I think
    _it is not really the Fiji water? But seriously there is no other explanation!”_ July 2018
3. _“We have been free from seizures_ for 11 months all from Fiji water. _”_ Sept. 2018


4. _“_ We have been seizure free since March. Been using only Fiji since for all water
    intake. _”_ September 2018
5. _“My son was on Fiji water for three weeks before we didn’t see any more seizures._
    When we make ice tea or fresh lemonade, we only use Fiji water. Also, I dilute his
    _juices with Fiji water. There have been times where he’s gone 1_ - 2 days without
    _drinking Fiji water. He’s been seizure free for one year now. I haven’t even_
    _mentioned it to the doctor that it was after drinking Fiji water. I just don’t want to_
    _hear how it is impossible that water can do such thing.” Sept_ ember 2018
6. _“My son is one month seizure free and 2 months since last seizure clusters. He has_
    _been on Fiji water for 2 months. I can’t express how grateful I am for the Fiji water._
    _It’s_ amazing. My son has been having seizures for almost 10 years. For last 8 years,
    he had been having 10- _20 seizures a month.” Sept_ ember 2018
7. _“We are going on 5 months of using Fiji water and have seen changes in frequency of_
    _my son’s seizures from weekly to_ every 5 weeks. We are quite happy with the results
    _as this has worked better than the different medicines we have tried.” August 2018_
8. _“My daughter is 6 months seizure free today! She has never reached the six month_
    _mark before, so it’s a pretty big deal. She has had no med changes but we switched_
    _her to Fiji water exclusively. Maybe it’s coincidence, but maybe not!” –_ Oct. 2018
9. _“My son_ has Dravet syndrome. We made a 100% switch to Fiji water. Things may
    have picked up a bit at first (not really sure since he was having so many every day).
    He went seizure free on day 9 and was for 30 days. After that the daily drops came
    back but not as frequent or as strong. Before Fiji he was falling on his face over 25
    _times every day. Since starting Fiji he hasn’t hit the ground since. He went over a_
    _year on Fiji and never hit the ground.”_ - Jan. 2019


10. _“My granddaughter has stubborn infantile spasms_ as well and was also on ketosis
    when her mom put her on Fiji. The Fiji helped her go from hundreds a day to just a
    _few. It was incredible!”_ - Dec. 2019
11. _“We just got back from a trip to Mexico with our family. My son has epilepsy that is_
    mostly resistant to meds. My son had a seizure the night before we left to Mexico. The
    resort we stayed at had strictly Fiji water! So we all were only drinking it. As I think
    back to the 12 day trip, he was swimming all day and definitely some later nights
    (seizure triggers being tired) but he did not have a seizure the whole time! Now was it
    _a coincidence or was it the water!? I definitely won’t be stoppin_ g the Fiji water
    _anytime soon!” –_ Jan. 2020
12. _“My daughter has autism and epilepsy and since starting her on Fiji wate_ r I have
    seen a big improvement with her. Not one seizure even when she had the flu just
    before Christmas, she has started talking, giving eye contact. I honestly can't believe
    the difference with her. I just switched my daughter to Fiji (she's always drank bottled
    _water anyway). She has just under a liter a day and has been on it for 4 months.” –_
    Jan. 2020

The results of an informal survey of 55 parents giving silica water to their children for
controlling seizures revealed the following: 26 found at least 75% reduction, 12 found 25%-74%
reduction, 3 found less than 25% reduction, and 14 found no reduction in seizures. Increased
speech was observed by 43 of 55 parents after giving their children silica water.

Since OSA in Fiji water is known to only remove aluminum from the body, including the brain,
these results give confirmation to the theory that in some cases accumulated aluminum in the
body is a causal factor of seizures.

I do recommend starting OSA rich water slowly (i.e., one cup a day for adults and one-half cup
for children) and then increasing to 3 to 4 cups a day, if there are no adverse side-effects (see
Chapter 7 for side-effects). Both Fiji water and Silicade contain 124ppm of OSA and most
children and adults do not have side-effects when drinking these silica waters.


#### Seizures Due to Vaccine Injury

Children get the largest amount of aluminum in their bodies from aluminum containing
vaccines^1. For instance, the DTaP vaccine, for diphtherias, tetanus, and acellular pertussis,
contains the highest amount of aluminum (i.e., 375mcg) as aluminum hydroxide per dose of any
vaccine given to children. Note that aluminum hydroxide causes seizures in monkeys^406 -^409.
DTaP vaccine is given four times at 2, 4, 6, and 72 months of age in the U.S.A. The warning
given to parents regarding this vaccine is: “Talk with your doctor if your child has a seizure or
collapsed after a dose of DTaP”^415. Dravet syndrome is a refractory epileptic syndrome that is
linked to inflammation following vaccination with vaccines containing aluminum adjuvants^479.

In order to prevent seizures after being given an aluminum containing vaccine it is recommended
that you give your child OSA rich water for at least two months after a vaccination with an
aluminum containing vaccine. The only caveat is there has been no study of vaccine efficacy as a
function of OSA concentration in drinking water.

All ingredients in a vaccine, except the weakened or killed disease virus or bacteria that act as
the antigen, are called excipients. The CDC maintains an online appendix of the “Pink Book”
titled “Vaccine Excipient & Media Summary” with a table of “Excipients Included in U.S.
Vaccines by Vaccine”. Aluminum is an excipient and vaccines that contain aluminum are listed
in Table 37. In order to keep current on vaccines that contain aluminum look for aluminum or
alum containing vaccines in this table:

https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/appendices/b/excipient-table-2.pdf

#### Seizures Due to Seizure Medications

Some seizure medications, such as ONFI (Clobazam suspension in solution), contain aluminum
salts and may cause an increased frequency of seizures. Magnesium aluminum silicate, an inert
ingredient in ONFI, is soluble in dilute hydrochloric acid as found in the human gut. Below pH
5.5 this compound releases aluminum ions in the human gut that are bioavailable.

the longer he was on it the worse his seizures got, until we started Fiji. ” Feb. 2020

### Stress and Inflammation Due to Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)

Oxidative stress created in cells and tissues of the body by damaging reactive oxygen species
(ROS) induces inflammation. Acute exposure to ROS is used by the body to control
pathogens^416. But chronic exposure to ROS due to environmental chemicals, such as aluminum,
and the resulting chronic inflammation leads to variety of diseases including: atherosclerosis,
chronic heart disease, stroke, cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and cellular death^416. ROS include
superoxide (O 2 *-) and hydrogen peroxide that are partially reduced by-products of oxygen
metabolism. These by-products are strongly oxidizing. Superoxide is produced by the electron
transport chain in the mitochondria that provide cellular energy^416.

Aluminum ions make a bad situation worse by bonding to superoxide making aluminum
superoxide^417 (AlO 2 *)2+. Aluminum superoxide is a ROS that is claimed to be an even stronger
oxidant than superoxide^418. Therefore, aluminum creates more stress and inflammation due to
ROS than another other metal (see Table 32)^219. Aluminum also increases expression of two sets
of genes that produce cell signaling molecules that promote inflammation and cell death:

- Pro-inflammatory transcription factor: NF-B - initiates processes that are
    detrimental to brain cell structure and function. These processes result in inflammatory
    neurodegeneration of the central nervous system^419.
- Pro-inflammatory cytokine: TNF- - activates NF-B and induces cell death
    particularly when exposed to excessive ROS generation and sustained activation of the
    enzyme caspase^416 ,4^20 ,4^21.

The following inflammatory diseases are associated with NF-B activation by TNF- and
therefore facilitated by aluminum accumulation in the body: atherosclerosis, multiple sclerosis,
rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD), and ulcerative colitis^420.


Controlling stress and inflammation due to ROS in the body can result in longevity^421 ,^422. There
are several ways of controlling stress and inflammation due to ROS and thereby increasing
longevity:

```
o Drink OSA rich water – facilitates the removal of aluminum and prevents both
the formation of aluminum superoxide and the expression of NF-B and TNF-
o Mitochondrial Superoxide Dismutase (SOD2) – enzymatic conversion of
superoxide to harmless oxygen and harmful hydrogen peroxide
o Catalase (CAT) – enzymatic conversion of harmful hydrogen peroxide to
harmless oxygen
o Alpha-Lipoic Acid (ALA) – exerts a protective effect against aluminum induced
oxidative stress when taken as a 50 – 300mg a day oral supplement^392
o FOXO3A3 gene – activation of the G allele of this gene by HSF1 leads to
increased expression of SOD2, CAT, and GADD45A. The GADD45A repairs
DNA damage done by ROS. HSF1 is a ROS stress relief factor that is increased in
the presence of ROS^423
```
Aluminum and superoxide make the perfect storm for increased ROS, leading to a number of
diseases including terminal diseases, such as chronic heart disease (CHD), stroke, and cancer^420.
Removal of aluminum by OSA rich water has the largest impact on ROS because, in addition to
the production of aluminum superoxide, aluminum also inhibits the production of both SOD 2
and CAT and increases expression of pro-inflammatory NF-B and TNF-^417 -^419 ,4^21. Secondary
to OSA rich water is ALA that when taken orally (50-300mg/day) provides protection from
aluminum induced oxidative stress^392.

In 2008 a remarkable study was published showing that the G allele of the FOXO3A3
(rs2802292) is strongly associated with human longevity^422. The study population was of
Japanese ethnicity recruited from 9,877 Japanese-American men who were born from 1900 to
1919 and were mostly born in Hawaii and living on the island of Oahu in 1965. In most cases
both parents of the study participants were born in Japan. In 1991 to 1993 blood samples and
phenotypic data were archived at the commencement of the Honolulu Asia Aging Study that


added 3,741 more male participants. In August 2007, 213 individuals who had lived to at least 95
years of age were grouped as “long-lived”, wherein their mean age at death was 98.7. Also 402
individual who had died before 82 were grouped as “average-lived”, wherein their mean age at
death was 78.5.

This 2008 study showed that 62% of ”long-lived” people had the TG or GG alleles of the
FOXO3A3 genotype as compared with only 44% of the “average-lived” people. In addition, the
“long-lived” people had 3.5 times less chronic heart disease, 2.26 times less stroke, and 1.47
times less cancer than the “average-lived” people. The study also demonstrated that those with
the TG or GG alleles of the FOXO3A3 gene (rs2802292) were healthier than those with only the
TT allele of this gene. But why is this specific gene allele associated with human longevity?

In 2018 the secret behind rs2802292 association with longevity was uncovered^423. Those people
lucky enough to have one or two copies of the G allele of the FOXO3A3 gene have a built-in
ROS suppression system in their cells. When ROS is detected the ROS suppression system is
tripped into action with a stress relief factor named HSF1. HSF1 and ROS activate expression of
the G allele of the FOXO3A3 gene. This initiates a cascade of cellular ROS stress relief by
producing the enzymes SOD2, CAT, and GADD45A. These enzymes detoxify ROS and repair
any DNA that was broken by ROS.


#### Telomere Length as a Biomarker of Longevity

In the Nicoyan longevity region long telomeres were found to be a positive biomarker of
longevity (see Table 15)^146 ,1^47. Telomeres are pieces of DNA on the ends of chromosomes that
protect the ends of chromosomes from sticking to each other. During cell division or
mitochondrial biogenesis a short piece of telomeres is lost every time DNA is replicated,
ultimately leading to ends of DNA “fraying” and either cellular or mitochondrial death.
Telomerase is an enzyme that repairs DNA by lengthening telomeres and thereby preventing
DNA from having “frayed” ends. Telomerase increases both telomere length and the healthy
longevity of cells and their mitochondria.

Homocysteine with ROS increase the rate of endothelial cell death by increasing the amount of
telomere length lost every time DNA is replicated^424. These effects of homocysteine are inhibited
by the hydrogen peroxide scavenger catalase indicating that ROS is involved^424. Aluminum not
only promotes ROS formation it also increases homocysteine levels by inhibiting the methylation
of homocysteine to methionine100,101. Metals that complex with desferoxamine (i.e., iron and
aluminum) have been found to facilitate ROS damage to mitochondrial DNA including
telomeres^425. By drinking OSA rich water, Nicoyans remove aluminum from their cells and
mitochondria thereby preventing mitochondrial DNA damage and death while keeping their
telomeres long. By drinking OSA rich water Okinawans have low homocysteine that protects
the endothelial cells that line their arteries from developing atherosclerosis (see Figure 10 ).

#### Conclusion of Stress and Inflammation Due to ROS

environmental chemicals, such as aluminum, and the resulting chronic inflammation leads to
variety of diseases including: atherosclerosis, chronic heart disease, stroke, cancer, rheumatoid
arthritis, and cellular death^416. Aluminum creates more stress and inflammation due to ROS than
another other metal (see Table 32)^219. Aluminum also increases expression of two sets of genes
that produce cell signaling molecules that promote inflammation and cell death. The mechanism
of FOXO3A3 gene acting as a ROS suppression system proves that decreasing oxidative stress
due to ROS in the body increases longevity. Therefore, since aluminum adds oxidative stress,


it is not surprising that drinking OSA rich water to facilitate aluminum elimination from
the body also increases longevity.

### Wrinkled Skin, Brittle Nails, and Hair Loss

If you are interested in living a healthy long life, I am sure you want to look your best along the
way. The most visible effects of aging occur in the skin, hair, and nails. Restoring or maintaining
a youthful appearance as you approach 100 years of life is a goal that can best be achieved on a
diet that includes supplemental OSA. This is because silicon is an essential element required for
metabolism of connective tissue that makes skin, hair, and nails^426.

Youthful skin appears soft and smooth. If you pinch youthful skin between your fingers and pull
then release, the skin will snap back in place due to collagen. As we age our outer tissues lose
their framework of structural proteins, such as collagen. Older skin sags and wrinkles as the
collagen becomes weaker. OSA both activates enzymes that cross-link collage and is
incorporated into structural proteins as a cross-linker^427 ,^428. This adds strength and elasticity to
your body’s structural proteins just as cross-linking with sulfur during vulcanization adds
strength and elasticity to rubber. This strength and elasticity will allow skin to snap back in place
preventing or removing wrinkles.

Silicon is also associated with the biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans that help create the
substance that fills the space between collagen and elastin^429. Because of this the silicon in OSA
is an essential component of healthy skin, hair, and nails.

Hair strands that have higher silicon content have greater brightness and a lower rate of falling
out. Silicon is also an important component of healthy nails. In fact, soft and brittle nails can
indicate a systemic silicon deficiency^429.


## Chapter 6 – Supplemental Dissolved Silica

The primary reason for taking supplemental silica is to decrease the accumulated aluminum
burden of your body’s organs. This will lower the risk of diseases, such as Alzheimer’s,
atherosclerosis, stroke, cancer, multiple sclerosis, and seizures leading to greater longevity. In
addition, supplemental silica may allow the brain to heal from aluminum accumulation and also
provide healing from autism and improve male fertility. Orthosilicic acid (OSA) acts as a pH
dependent selective chelator of aluminum. Unlike classical metal chelators, such as EDTA, that
bind to a wide variety of metal ions, OSA binds only to aluminum hydroxide dimers at pH
greater than 5.5 (see Chapter 2). For example, OSA does not bind to iron3+ that has the same
ionic charge and approximately the same size as aluminum. Remarkable OSA supplementation
even facilitates the removal of aluminum from bones that were once thought to be a stable sink
for aluminum in the body.

OSA’s remarkable ability to selectively facilitate the elimination of aluminum from the body has
been proven in rats and humans. The following conclusions were reached with rats on a
supplemental silica diet that involved oral administration of dissolved silica as OSA in water at
concentrations of 200 and 400ppm for 5 weeks with and without supplemental aluminum as
discussed in Chapter 2:

- In every tissue and organ tested, including brain, bone, liver, spleen, and kidneys, the
    prior accumulated aluminum is decreased by supplemental OSA^64.
- The reversal in aluminum accumulation is dose dependent averaging 58% with 200ppm
    of OSA and 7 9 % with 400ppm of supplemental OSA after just 5 weeks^64.
- OSA at twice its saturation level in water (i.e., 400ppm) is more effective at lowering
    aluminum accumulation than at its 200ppm saturation level^64. This implies that insoluble
    OSA, formed in supersaturated OSA, may bind to some of the aluminum in the gut
    preventing aluminum absorption^30.

Drinking OSA rich water at 50 ppm to 160ppm, such as Fiji water and Silicade (both 146 ppm),
facilitates the elimination of aluminum in human urine30,73,79 and perspiration^74. Drinking OSA
rich beer has also been found to facilitate the elimination of aluminum in human urine79,80.


Drinking OSA rich water at concentrations over OSA’s saturation level (i.e., 200ppm) without
sufficient water for dilution can result in painful silica kidney stones. Likewise taking
dissolvable OSA polymers or magnesium silicate without sufficient water for dilution can also
result in painful kidney stones as discussed in Chapter 1. Therefore, the safest and most effective
silica supplement is OSA rich silica water at a concentration of less than 200ppm.

See Appendix I for a list of international silica waters and a description of silica in beer.

### The Good and Poor Silica Supplements

In order to lower the body’s burden of accumulated aluminum the orally ingested silica
supplement must be absorbed by the gut and travel in the blood to the organs. This is called silica
bioavailability. The more bioavailable a silica supplement is the more effective it is at facilitating
the elimination in urine and sweat of accumulated aluminum. Therefore, a good silica
supplement with high bioavailability is dissolved OSA rich silica water. While a poor silica
supplement has low bioavailability and remains in the gut to be excreted as feces and does not
remove accumulated aluminum from the body’s organs.

Some low bioavailability supplements are called “binders” and include plant fibers containing
water insoluble biosilifications, diatomaceous earth, clays, activated carbon, zeolites, silica
polymers, and colloidal suspensions of silica. Ingesting binders is not necessary because some of
the vegetables, fruit, and grain we eat contain biosilifications that are very effective binders for
aluminum in the gut (see Chapter 4). For instance 99.8% of the aluminum we ingest with food is
not absorbed by the body and is instead bound to water insoluble biosilifications and excreted in
feces. Some of the remaining 0.2% of aluminum can be prevented from being absorbed into the
blood by drinking supplemental dissolved OSA during or after a meal^64. Some binders, such as
zeolites and clays, contain complexed aluminum that in the acidity of the human gut can become
labile ionic aluminum that is absorbed. Table 33 compares the good and poor silica supplements
by their bioavailability of OSA.


The only recommended supplements are three to four cups a day of OSA rich silica water
(e.g., natural such as Fiji or synthetic such as Silicade) as a daily supplement^1. The half-life
of absorbed OSA in the blood is approximately 3 hours^79. Therefore, drinking a cup of OSA rich
silica water every 3 to 4 hours during the day is the optimal strategy for aluminum elimination.
Most people do not have side-effects when drinking 3 to 4 cups of OSA rich silica water over a
period of 9 to 12 hours during the day (see Chapter 7 for side-effects). However, if you do have
suspected side-effects, cut back to 1 cup a day and slowly increase to 3 to 4 cups a day.

Choline stabilized OSA, sold as Biosil, is a combination of 2 00mg of choline with 10mg of
silicon as silica. Only 17% of the silica in Biosil is bioavailable as OSA compared with 43%
bioavailability with natural waters and Silicade. Also, there is a 70% greater risk of lethal
prostate cancer with high (500mg/day) choline diets^430. Therefore, The European Food Safety
Authority recommends that liquid choline stabilized OSA be taken at a maximum dose of 10
drops equivalent to 10 mg. of silicon complexed with 200mg of choline per day^431 ,4^32. Also,
since the use of Biosil in children has not been studied, the Biosil Corporation does not
recommend it to be taken by children under age seven.


### Natural OSA Rich Silica Water Supplements

Good silica supplements are high in dissolved OSA and include natural OSA rich silica waters
and beers. The commercially available natural OSA rich silica waters that I have tested are
indicated with a ”*” and there is a more comprehensive list of silica waters in Appendix I:

- Starkey Spring Water from Idaho is available from Whole Foods (94ppm OSA*)
- Fiji water from Fiji is available in the U.S.A. (1 46 ppm OSA*)
- Langkawi Pure from Malaysia is available in Asia and U.S.A. (133ppm OSA*)
- Volvic water from France is available in the U.S.A. and Europe (51 ppm OSA*)
- Gerolsteiner from Germany is available in Europe (64ppm OSA*)
- Acilis water from Malaysia is available in Europe (88ppm OSA)

OSA is present in beer, non-alcoholic beer, wine, and some sprits. The grain used for brewing
beer adds dissolved silica during preparation. The mean OSA level of 76 different beers was
found to be 6 5.3ppm OSA^191. Some of these beers have high levels of OSA, such as the non-
alcoholic beer Clausthaler Premium with 118ppm of OSA^79. Appendix I has a list of the
amounts of OSA in different types of beer.

### Synthetic OSA Rich Silica Water Supplement

In 2009 synthetic silica water, like Silicade, but containing only 73ppm of OSA was made and
tested for its bioavailability in healthy human volunteers 19-40 years of age (16 males and 16
females)^79. Urinary silicon was used as a surrogate maker of bioavailable silicon17,192. The
percentage of silicon excreted in the urine over a 6-hour period was 43.1% + 3.6% making it one
of the best sources of supplemental silica available. Serum silicon was also measured during this
6 - hour period and was found to start at 120 mcg/liter, peak at 670 mcg/liter after 2 hours, and
then decline slowly to 200 mcg/liter after 6 hours^79. In 2000 synthetic silica water was shown to
enhance 26-aluminum radioisotope excretion by 75% in several volunteers^30. This demonstrates
that synthetic silica is absorbed in the gut, dissolved in the blood, collected by the kidneys,
excreted in the urine, and enhances urinary aluminum excretion.


This synthetic silica water was made from concentrated liquid alkaline sodium silicate that was
purchased from the Aldrich Chemical Company (7 mol Si/liter containing 10.5% as Na 2 O and
27% SiO 2 with a SiO 2 to Na 2 O ratio of 3.22). The procedure involved diluting the basic sodium
silicate in water and then acidifying with hydrochloric acid to pH 7.0 – 7.2. The final solutions
contained 73ppm OSA (21.4 mg Si) as measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission
spectrometry^79 and 96ppm (1mmole/L) OSA after incubating for one week^30.

#### Silicade as a Synthetic OSA Rich Silica Water Supplement

Making silicon rich water weekly at home is easy and much less expensive and more sustainable
than purchasing water bottled in Fiji or Malaysia. I call this water “Silicade” and there is a You
Tube Video on how to make it at **“Silica Water – How to Make it at Home”**. Silicade provides
124ppm of dissolved silica to lower your body-burden of aluminum. Silicade preparation
requires only two ingredients and a set of small measuring spoons that in the U.S.A. can be
purchased online and shipped to your home. Silicade can be stored indefinitely in the dark like
Fiji water. The chemicals to make Silicade store well and should be kept out of children’s reach:

- Low Alkalinity Hydrous Sodium Silicate: a hydrous powder available online from
    ChemicalStore.com. The powder is safer and easier to measure than the liquid form but
    has the same ratio of 3.22 SiO 2 to Na 2 O. The powder has a as a purity of 99.5% and a
    formula of SiO 2 [Na 2 O]1/3.22 H 2 O (18.5% water) Mw of 9 7.25. **Only order “sodium**
    silicate **– low alkalinity”.** Do not order **“sodium silicate – alkaline” from the**
    ChemicalStore.com or Zchemicals.com. This powdery chemical can be stored
    indefinitely in its screw-cap plastic container but slowly clumps. The clumps are easily
    converted back to powder with a small mortar and pestle.
    Note: This solid sodium silicate from the Chemical Store is Product G manufactured by
    the PQ Corporation of Valley Forge, PA. Brenntag Specialties (Telephone No. 888 - 926 -
    4151) buys Product G from PQ Corporation and resells it worldwide as G Sodium
    Silicate product number 387721 in 50-pound bags. ChemicalStore.com and
    Zchemicals.com buy this product from Brenntag Specialties and sell it in 2-pound
    containers online.


- Sodium Bisulfate (a.k.a. Sodium Hydrogen Sulfate): a white powder 99.5% pure of
    micro-prills (i.e., very small pellets) from Professor Fullwood of LoudWolf Ltd. is
    available from Amazon. Note: both optional calcium chloride and magnesium chloride
    are available from the same source.
- Mini Measuring Spoon Set: Norpro 3061D from Dine Company Online. Currently
    priced under $4 without shipping. Three measuring spoons come attached to a single
    ring. Only the dash (1/8 of a teaspoon) and smidgen (1/32 of a teaspoon) are used for
    Silicade preparation. In order to avoid accidental use of the wrong measuring spoon,
    remove the pinch from the ring. Note: i **n the early 2000’s some companies, such as**
    Norpro and Dine, began defining and accurately calibrating the dash and smidgen
    measuring spoons as precise fractions of a teaspoon. Do not use antique dash and
    smidgen measuring spoons as they may not be correctly calibrated.
- Spatula: Any small spatula with a straight-edge works to level the contents of the
    measuring spoons prior to addition.

Detailed Instructions with Options for Making Silicade

By following these detailed instructions, you can prepare a gallon of Silicade or just follow the
“Short Recipe for Silicade” that follows after these detailed instructions:

1) A level dash and two level smidgens ( 3 / 16 of a teaspoon, 600 mg) of hydrous powdered
sodium silicate is placed in a Pyrex glass measuring cup. Add 1/8 cup of tap water and bring
to boiling in the microwave or on the stove, and let boil for 30sec. This powder contains
99.5% water soluble sodium silicate monohydrate and a maximum of 0.5% of water
insoluble materials, as required by the American Waterworks Standard B 104 - 98 for adding
sodium silicate to drinking water^23.
Note: Do not heat to boiling more than 1/8 cup of tap water as more water will lower
the pH making the sodium silicate less soluble.

2) The hot water with dissolved sodium silicate is immediately diluted to one gallon (3.785
liters) with cold tap water resulting in a 1. 32 mM/liter (12 7 ppm) solution of pH 9.8 OSA.


3) One level dash ( 1 / 8 of a teaspoon, 0.83 gr, 6.9 mM) of sodium bisulfate is added to the
solution of OSA and dissolved with stirring in order to acidify the solution to pH 4 to 5.
Optionally, if tap water is more basic than pH 8.5, use a pH meter while slowly adding a
little more sodium bisulfate in order to lower the pH to 4.0-5.0. A pH 7.0 standard solution is
recommended for periodic calibration of the pH meter.

4) The clear colorless acidic solution of OSA is further purified by filtering through a Brita
pitcher style filter resulting in OSA at a pH of 4.4. This removes impurities added with
sodium silicate and sodium bisulfate.

5) Two level smidgens of sodium bicarbonate (a.k.a. baking soda) are added and dissolved with
stirring in the gallon of filtered OSA, resulting in Silicade with a pH of 6.5, a TDS of 285 at
25 oC, and less than 2mcg/L labile aluminum. Each quart of freshly-made Silicade contains
3 7.4mg of dissolved silicon as 1 27 ppm of monomeric (OSA). If allowed to stand for 72
hours at 25oC, the OSA concentration increases to 146ppm.

6) Optionally make Silicade Plus Calcium, if tap water is low in calcium, add two level
dashes of calcium chloride flakes or prills (840mg 36% calcium) 99% pure from
Loudwolf/Amazon. This will increase the calcium level by 80 ppm, the TDS to 450 at 25oC,
and the pH to 6.6 in a gallon of Silicade + Ca. Labile aluminum in calcium enriched Silicade
is less than 2mcg/L. Calcium at concentrations greater than or equal to 75ppm have a
significant protective effect on cognition^433. Optionally in order to increase magnesium by
20ppm add a dash of magnesium chloride hexahydrate (> 98 % purity) from
LoudWolf/Amazon. Optionally make Sparkling Silicade – Carbonating Silicade will result
in a pH 4.5 sparkling beverage.

Drink 3 to 4 cups of Silicade a day around meal times in order to provide a total of 30 .5 to
40.7mg of silicon as monomeric OSA. This is 7. 9 to 1 2 .3 times the 3.3mg of silicon that when
consumed as OSA per day was observed to lower the frequency of AD^118. Silicade contains 12 7 -
146 ppm of OSA and in the U.S.A. 160 ppm of OSA (i.e., 100 ppm of SiO 2 ) is generally
recognized as safe in drinking water^22.

A You Tube video of this procedure is at: **“Silica Water – How to Make it at Home”**


Why This Recipe Works

The goal of this recipe for orthosilicic acid (OSA) in drinking water is to use an easily measured
solid silica powder and an acidic microprill that are commercially available online and shipped to
anyone, not just chemical laboratories. Both of these chemicals are high purity (i.e., 99.5%).

- Solubilize sodium silicate: Boiling powdered sodium silicate for 30 seconds in an eighth
    of a cup of tap water keeps the pH high enough (i.e., pH = 13) to solubilize silicate^434 -^436.
- Neutralize to form OSA and prevent polymerization: In order to form OSA and other
    silica species in equilibrium with OSA^489 and to prevent OSA polymerization^435 -^437 ,
    immediately dilute the basic (i.e., pH=13) OSA solution to a gallon with tap water and
    then immediately render the solution non-hazardous by acidifying the solution to pH 4
    to 5 with the solid acid sodium bisulfate. A 1. 32 M OSA solution is well below OSA’s
    saturation level in water (i.e., 2 - 3mM) but requires 72 hours to fully stabilize rising from
    127 ppm immediately after preparation to 1 46 ppm^174. Polymerization of OSA has been
    observed at neutral pH only well above OSA’s 200ppm saturation level^435 -^437.
- Remove Aluminum: For optimal aluminum removal acidify the OSA solution with
    sodium bisulfate to pH 4.0 to 5.0 and then filter through a Brita pitcher style filter
    (OB03)^174. A significant portion (i.e., 98.5%) of the labile aluminum introduced in tap
    water is removed^17 4,175. This Brita filter is a combined activated carbon and weak cation
    exchange resin that removes cations like aluminum but does not remove OSA^174. If the
    tap water used for Silicade is between pH 6.5 to 8.5, as per EPA’s secondary drinking
    water standard, then after acidification, filtration, and bicarbonate addition Silicade will
    be pH 6.5.
- Optionally add Calcium and/or Magnesium: Have your tap water checked and if it is
    low in calcium and/or magnesium, add supplemental calcium and/or magnesium to
    Silicade. The Brita filter reduces calcium and magnesium in Quabbin tap water by one
    half^175. Drinking water with calcium at levels of 80mg and magnesium at levels of 20
    ppm has been found to be optimal for good health^438. This may be due to calcium and
    magnesium competing with aluminum for absorption by the gut^433. Calcium catalyzes
    the polymerization of OSA but only at pH greater than 818,19. Silicade + Ca is pH 6.6^ and
    at this pH OSA in Silicade + Ca is primarily a non-polymeric monomer^174 ,^439.


## Chapter 7- Safety of OSA Ingestion and Handling of Sodium Silicate

A safe strategy for OSA supplementation is to start with 1 cup a day for adults or ½ cup a
day for children and work up to drinking 3 to 4 cups over a 9 to 12-hour period during the
day of either silica rich mineral water or homemade Silicade (see Appendix I and Chapter
6). Mothers should drink OSA rich water prior to pregnancy and, if there are no side
effects, continue drinking OSA rich water during pregnancy and while breast feeding.

### Side-effects of Taking Supplemental OSA Rich Silica Water

Most people do not have side-effects. But starting on OSA rich water should be done slowly with
lower doses while checking for side-effects. Side-effects include: headache, due to an increase of
aluminum in both urine and blood. Supplemental OSA temporarily enhances aluminum levels in
the urine as shown in Figure 7b^77. Side-effects can also include fatigue and irritability, likely due
to aluminum inhibiting glycolysis^442. Glycolysis is the body’s way of getting energy from
carbohydrates. These side-effects may be more pronounced in those people who have
accumulated more aluminum or are routinely consuming too much aluminum. Therefore,
eliminating sources of aluminum from the diet and OSA supplementation are recommended (see
Appendix I and II). Taking OSA in small doses during the day will lessen side-effects.

### Safety of OSA Ingestion

It is safe to ingest dissolved silicates, such as OSA, at concentrations well below the
saturation level (i.e., less than 200ppm of OSA) in order to ensure that they will not become
supersaturated and crystallize in the kidney lumen.

OSA is the monomeric bioavailable form of dissolved silica commonly found in rivers, lakes,
aquifers, and drinking waters around the world^435. “Dissolved silica from commercial soluble
silicates is indistinguishable from natural dissolved silica.”^191. The amount of OSA in drinking
water varies widely depending upon the source (see Chapter 5). In the U.S.A. 160 ppm of
dissolved silicates, such as OSA, are generally recognized as safe (GRAS) in drinking water by
the FDA^22. The adequate intake of water per day is 3 liters for men and 2.3 liters for women.


This level of water intake corresponds to a maximum safe level of OSA intake per day of 480 mg
for men and 368 mg for women. Therefore, drinking 3 to 4 cups of supplemental silica water each
day containing a total of 90 to 138 mg of OSA (equivalent to 26.5 to 40.5mg of Si) is well below
the GRAS level for dissolved silicates (see Table 33).

Ingesting OSA near or above the saturation level (i.e., 200ppm) can result in kidney stones
(a.k.a. nephrolithiasis) in dogs but almost never in humans. There is one report of kidney stones
resulting from a silicate salt incorrectly labeled as SiO 2 and used as an inactive ingredient (a.k.a.
excipient) in several over-the-counter drugs such as Uncaria Tomentosa, Digestive Advantage,
and FlexProtein supplements^441.

### Safety of Low Bioavailability, Untested, and Zeolite Containing Products

Choline stabilized OSA, sold as Biosil, is a combination of 2 00mg of choline with 10mg of
silicon as silicate. There is a 70% greater risk of lethal prostate cancer with high (500mg/day)
choline diets^430. Note that The European Food Safety Authority therefore recommends that
liquid choline stabilized OSA be taken at a maximum dose of 10 drops equivalent to 10 mg of
silicon as silicate complexed with 200mg of choline per day^431 ,4^32. Also, since the use of Biosil in
children has not been studied, the Biosil Corporation does not recommend it to be used in
children under age seven.

Jarrow Formulas have developed a product called JarroSil that contains molecular clusters of
stabilized silicic acid. JarroSil is less expensive per ounce than BioSil, but JarroSil only contains
0.4 mg of silicon as silicic acid per drop as compared with 1 mg of silicon per drop in BioSil.
No tests have been published on the safety or JarroSil or the bioavailability of OSA in JarroSil.

In Europe a company, Silicium Laboratories, is promoting a non-natural silica as a supplement
called monomethyl silanetriol (MMST). MMST in water is absorbed by the gut and made 64%
bioavailable when dissolved in alcohol free beer^79. There is no data showing that MMST
facilitates elimination of aluminum from the body. In addition, the lack of toxicity data on
MMST makes it impossible to recommend MMST at the present time.

Zeolites are microporus alumininosilicate minerals that are both produced on large scale
industrially and also occur in nature. Depending on how they are made, they can exist in


different 3 - D frameworks. Zeolites when inhaled can cause lung cancer. Zeolites when taken
orally decrease immune activity in the body, facilitate the removal of essential minerals from the
gut, dissolve aluminum into the gut, and decrease the effectiveness of some oral medications.
Therefore, zeolites can’t be recommended as an oral supplement.

Clinoptilolite Zeolite as nanoparticles has been commercially promoted under the tradename
TRS for toxic metal detox. However, oral administration of clinoptilolite zeolite has not been
shown to facilitate elimination of aluminum. In fact, it has been shown that there is a net release
of dissolved aluminum from clinoptilolite in simulated human gastric fluid^482. Accumulation of
zeolites in the body during long term use of TRS is a health risk as dissolution of slowly
accumulating zeolites will increase aluminum exposure to organs of the body, such as the brain.
This is evidenced by the amount of aluminum in urine being proportional to the number of years
ingesting clinoptilolite zeolites. For example: no zeolite ingestion 7.5ppm, 1-3 years of zeolite
ingestion 15.3ppm, and 6-13 years of zeolite ingestion 39.9ppm of aluminum in urine^483.

Simulated digestion of clinoptilolite zeolite as particles larger than nanoparticles has been shown
to result in a net release of dissolved aluminum^482 in spite of the proven ability of clinoptilolite
zeolite to absorb aluminum^484. The researchers point out that this loss of material during gastric
digestion “might be related to the possible dissolution process of aluminosilicates at the surface
layer ...”^482. The smaller the size of the zeolite particle - the greater the surface layer and the
faster aluminum is dissolved from the zeolite. This is disturbing because a 1 nanometer sized
particle has over 10,000 times more surface area than larger particles used in the simulated
digestion study^482. Therefore, it can be predicted that much more aluminum will dissolve after
ingestion of nanoparticles as compared with larger particles of zeolite.

This data has convinced the FDA that clinoptilolite zeolites should not be generally regarded as
safe (GRAS) when ingested by animals. In a May 4th 2018 letter from Dr. David Edwards, the
Director of the Division of Animal Feeds for the FDA, to a producer of animal feed containing
clinoptilolite zeolites, Dr. Edwards said their animal feeds are not GRAS because the use of
clinoptilolite zeolites in animal feed **“... could cause potential excess levels of aluminum ... in
some species”**^485.


### Interactions of Epsom Salt baths with Drinking OSA

Aluminum accumulation in the body inhibits both the methylation and transsulfuration
pathways100,101. This results in higher-than-normal levels of homocysteine and lower than normal
levels of SAM, reduced glutathione, and sulfate that are biomarkers for autism^1 ,455. Some people
have recommended Epsom salt (i.e., magnesium sulfate) baths as a way to supplement sulfate in
those with autism.

The concentration of sulfate increases in the urine by 50 to 75% for at least 24 hours after a 12-
minute bath in a dilute 1% (i.e., 1 gr. per 100cc) Epsom salt solution^456. For instance, the mean
pre-bath sulfate level in the urine of 19 people (14-64 years of age, 10 males and 9 females) was
60ppm with a mean post-bath sulfate level of 105ppm^456.

Also, the concentration of magnesium increases in the blood due to Epson salt baths. Blood
magnesium rises on average 9% after a 12-minute Epson salt bath and blood magnesium rises
35% after 7 days of daily bathing for 12-minutes per day in an Epson salt bath^456. Higher than
normal levels of magnesium in the blood of children is called hypermagnesemia that can inhibit
the enzyme Na+/K+^ ATPase that is responsible for potassium ion transport into the intracellular
space in neurons and muscle^457. Aluminum also inhibits Na+/K+^ ATPase^490. This inhibition by
either or both magnesium and aluminum also causes inhibition of choline reuptake and
cholinergic disruption as is fully explained on rung 17 in my book “Finding a Cause and
Potential Cures for Alzheimer’s Disease”.

Therefore, Epson salt baths may stifle the benefits seen in drinking OSA rich silica water to
facilitate elimination of aluminum. The following anecdotal information supports this
conclusion:

_“My 9 year old son has severe autism ... After previous Epsom Salt baths he has been fine, although no
real obvious improvements. However, the first one I decided to give him since he started drinking silica
water 9 weeks ago stopped the silica water improvements in their tracks and he resorted back to his pre-
silica-water-self for example lots of hand/arm movements, repeating words rather than asking for
things, less calm, and obsessive behavior”. September 2018_


### Handling of Sodium Silicate

One of the questions repeatedly asked is: “Can sodium silicate cause silicosis?” First of all
silicosis is an occupational lung disease caused by inhaling crystalline silica dust less than 10
micrometers in diameter. There are seven different forms of crystalline silica and they all consist
of water insoluble silicon dioxide (a.k.a. SiO 2 ). Sodium silicate (Na 2 Si3.22O7.44) is the sodium salt
of water-soluble silicic acid (Si(OH) 4 ). Sodium silicate is not silicon dioxide and therefore
inhalation of sodium silicate powder does not cause silicosis.

Sodium silicate when dissolved in water is basic (pH greater than 7) and if not neutralized with
an acid, such as sodium bisulfate, could cause skin and eye irritation. This same type of irritation
is felt when soap gets into the eyes while bathing, as soap is also basic. In order to prevent
irritation, avoid skin and eye contact with sodium silicate as a powder or as a non-neutralized
solution in water. If experiencing skin or eye irritation while handling sodium silicate, then
rinse the exposed area with excess water until the irritation subsides.

Hydrous low alkalinity sodium silicate powder as purchased from the ChemicalStore.com is
comprised of crystalline clusters that are not small enough to be suspended in air as a dust. In
addition, powdered sodium silicate has virtually no vapor pressure at room temperature and does
not evaporate or sublime into air even in boiling water. At above 1,100oC the vapor pressure of
sodium silicate is still 20,000-fold less than water at room temperature^440. So, for these reasons
no special respiratory protection is required when measuring sodium silicate powder or
boiling sodium silicate powder in water.

Keep all chemicals out of the reach of children.


## Conclusion – Resiliency for Healthy Longevity

As the world changes so must we in order to survive. Resiliency is the ability to adjust to these
changes. We entered the Aluminum Age in 1888 when Karl Joseph Bayer developed a process
to refine aluminum from bauxite ore. This process opened a Pandora’s Box of low-cost
aluminum products that have changed our life for the better and our health for the worse. Our
collective survival requires that we all become individually resilient to our increasing exposure
to aluminum. By taking clues from plants and animals that are resilient to aluminum exposure
and by studying the resiliency of those living in the longevity regions of the world, the secret has
been discovered of how to prevent and heal from aluminum toxicity in the Aluminum Age:

```
Drinking OSA rich silica water can reduce aluminum accumulation in our bodies
and prevent 7 terminal diseases in which aluminum is a causal factor: Alzheimer’s ,
heart disease, stroke, cancer, multiple sclerosis, osteoporosis, and Parkinson’s. Also
drinking OSA rich silica water can improve the odds of conception and lower the
risk of autism and seizures and even heal from autism and seizures.
```
This technological breakthrough was made by a group of dedicated researchers who have spent
the last two decades making the following important discoveries:

- Silica water taken orally facilitates the elimination of aluminum from the body, in both
    urine and sweat, and prevents aluminum accumulation in the body.
- There are six longevity regions in the world where people live significantly longer than
    those living just outside the longevity regions.
- Silica, as OSA, is at higher-than-normal concentrations in the drinking water of all six
    longevity regions.
- There are a number of diseases whose incidence is increasing in lock-step with
    worldwide aluminum production.
- In all cases aluminum accumulation has been shown to be a causal factor of these
    diseases.


We are confronted with the rising incidence of a number of terminal mismatch diseases. In these
cases, our Paleolithic bodies are mismatched to our changing environment by being inadequately
adapted to the aluminum age. Since these diseases cause mortality and reduce the longevity of
populations around the world, by drinking OSA rich silica water and eating OSA rich vegetables
the risk of these diseases can be reduced, resulting in healthy longevity. The information in this
book provides a mechanism for both individual and cultural adaption. Individual and cultural
resiliency gives us the strength to adapt by taking action and supplementing our drinking water
with OSA rich silica water and eating OSA rich vegetables. In addition, we can take steps to
lower our aluminum ingestion and that of our children.

Not everyone has the necessary individual resiliency to adapt their diet and lifestyle for self-
protection from mismatch diseases. A case in point is Professor Louis F. Fieser. For the fall
semester at Harvard in 1965 I had high expectations of taking Professor Fieser’s Chem. 20
course on organic chemistry. To my great disappointment a substitute teacher explained
Professor Fieser had been diagnosed with lung cancer, had a lung removed, and would not be
teaching Chem. 20. The ironic part of the story is that in 1962 Professor Fieser had served as one
of the ten men on the U.S. Surgeon General’s advisory committee that issued the influential 1964
report concluding smoking is a causal factor of lung cancer. Even though he agreed with
committee’s conclusion, he did not stop smoking four packs a day until his lung was removed.

This book is a handbook for individual resiliency in the aluminum age as it contains the
following information:

- Natural mineral waters of the world that contain OSA greater than 49ppm listed by country
- Vegetables containing OSA listed in order of their OSA content
- Beer types of the world that contain high levels of OSA are ranked by type
- Complete instructions for Silicade an inexpensive homemade synthetic OSA rich silica water
- Daily sources of aluminum listed with the amount of aluminum per serving
- Plots of increasing incidence of mismatch diseases versus increasing aluminum production
- The science behind why aluminum is a likely causal factor of these mismatch diseases
- The science behind why drinking silica water facilitates the elimination of aluminum
- Anecdotal information of recovery from autism, seizures, and MS with silica water & OSA


A perfect example of individual resiliency is that mothers should drink OSA rich water prior to
pregnancy and, if there are no side effects, continue drinking OSA rich water during pregnancy
and while breast feeding. We can also display our individual resiliency and give our children
silica water for at least several months after vaccinations with aluminum containing vaccines.

You may wonder why your doctor hasn’t mentioned drinking OSA rich water on a regular basis
for healthy longevity. The information presented in this book is primarily the result of recent
research and your doctor is likely unaware of this research. The pharmaceutical industry is the
primary source of information on new drugs. Silica water is not a pharmaceutical drug and
therefore will not be promoted by drug companies for prescription by doctors. Medical training
and traditions can be counter to the adoption of new innovations. Your choice is to wait for
medical practice to catch up with research or you can start drinking silica water and see for
yourself.

I hope this book becomes a handbook for cultural resiliency as there is nothing stopping any
community from becoming a longevity region by just adding OSA to their drinking water. There
is already an American Water Works Standard B404-98 for adding OSA (i.e., sodium silicate) to
community drinking water for corrosion control^23. Why not add OSA to community drinking
water for both corrosion control and public health?

Also, we should demonstrate our cultural resiliency and demand that aluminum not be added to
food. In addition, we should demand that if aluminum is found to be naturally present in food,
the concentration of aluminum should be printed on the product label.

Also, we should demonstrate our cultural resiliency and demand that aluminum not be added to
vaccines. In addition, all vaccine schedules should be changed to postpone vaccination with
aluminum containing vaccines until children are 3 months or older. Finally, we should work to
avoid vaccinating children with vaccines that both contain aluminum and are not lifesaving
vaccines.


## Appendix I – Bottled Silica Waters of the World

This following list of silica waters of the world was provided by Paul Watling and
[http://www.finewaters.com/bottled-waters-of-the-world.](http://www.finewaters.com/bottled-waters-of-the-world.) When purchasing silica water be sure
to check the label as silica levels can be subject to change.




### Beer as a Source of OSA

Commercial bottled beer contains high levels of OSA ranging from 22 to 192ppm of OSA. Beer
made from the grist of barley contains more silica than beer made from the grist of wheat (see
Table 23). Even though hops contain more silica than grains, the amount of hops used in beer is
relatively small compared to grain. Therefore, most of the silica is added by grain. During
brewing most of the silica remains with the spent grains. But with aggressive treatment of the
liquid extracted from the mashing process much of this silica is released as OSA that survives
into beer^443. For average OSA levels in different types of beer see Table 3 5.

### Avoid Drinking from Aluminum Cans and Bottles

Beers and soft drinks sold in aluminum cans should be avoided whenever possible. The enamel
coating on the inside of the can contains pinholes that allow beer to corrode the aluminum can
adding aluminum to beer^1. This corrosion adds both neurotoxic aluminum and, for some of us, a
metallic taste to the beer. Approximately 30% of people can taste high levels of aluminum.


## Appendix II – Daily Sources of Aluminum

Aluminum can be accumulated in the body by oral ingestion, inhaled as vapor, or injected as an
adjuvant in a vaccine. Orally ingested aluminum is preferentially accumulated in the brain,
bone, liver, spleen, and kidney of rats^64 and the brain, breast, retinal, and ovarian tissues of
mice^444. Aluminum has also been shown to accumulate in the brains of humans^266. Inhaled
aluminum is preferentially accumulated in the brain of rats via the olfactory nerve^67. Aluminum
in tobacco and cannabis (as much as 0.37% and 0.4% by weight respectively) is volatilized
during smoking and is absorbed by the lungs during both active and passive second-hand
exposure to smoke^445.

Avoid products with any ingredient on a label than includes the words: alum, alumina,
aluminum, or bauxite.

Daily sources of aluminum are listed in Table 3 6 with the highest indicated with a “*” :





## Appendix III – Vaccines That Contain Aluminum

Vaccines contain aluminum as an adjuvant. When injected this aluminum is 23% to 73%
bioavailable as opposed to ingested aluminum in foods and water that is only 0.2% bioavailable
(i.e., the amount that gets into the blood stream and is accumulated or excreted as urine.)
Aluminum that is used as an adjuvant in the vaccine is released slowly over at least 28 days after
the vaccination^451. Some of the aluminum adjuvants injected as vaccines in rabbits have been
found to be accumulated in their brains^451.

Note that depending upon manufacturer the amount of aluminum for a given vaccine can vary by
a factor of approximately 2. When possible, ask for the lower dose of aluminum:

- Daptacel 330mcg and Infanrix 625mcg
- Quadracel 330mcg and Kinrix 600mcg
- Engerix 250mcg and Recombivax 500mcg
- Gardisil 225mcg and Gardasil 9 500mcg


## Appendix IV – Testing for Silica in Drinking Water

In drinking water there are primarily two forms of silica: silicon dioxide and OSA. Silicon
dioxide exists in water as insoluble colloidal silica particles that if orally ingested temporarily
remain in the gut and are not absorbed into the blood. OSA is soluble in water up to its saturation
level of 200 ppm. If OSA rich water is orally ingested approximately 50% of the dissolved OSA
is absorbed from the gut into the blood making it bioavailable, unlike silicon dioxide. Only
bioavailable OSA can facilitate the removal of aluminum from the body’s internal organs. The
silicon dioxide in drinking water taken from an aquifer in which the water has had a long
residence time (i.e., many years) usually has been slowly converted with the addition of two
water molecules to OSA.

Drinking water is usually analyzed for silica in one of two ways:

- The AWWA Silica Assay: The total amount of both silicon dioxide and OSA in drinking
    water is analyzed and reported as silica or SiO 223. If the water contains primarily OSA,
    then multiplying the silica or SiO 2 concentration by 1.6 gives the OSA concentration.
- **Coradin’s Silicomolybdic** Spectrophotometric Blue Assay: Only OSA and the OSA
    dimer are detected by a procedure that does not detect colloids of SiO 229. OSA is usually
    reported as the OSA or Si(OH) 4 concentration.

The best test for OSA is Coradin’s Silicomolybdic Spectrophotometric Blue Assay as it does not
detect silica colloids that are not bioavailable. However, because of its simplicity, the AWWA
Silica Assay is more commonly performed.

### AWWA Total Silica Gravimetric Assay of Drinking Water

A drinking water sample is filtered through a medium porosity porous-porcelain filter crucible to
remove suspended matter larger than 10- 15 microns in size. Note that silica colloids are not
removed as they are usually more than a thousand times smaller. Fifty milliliters of the filtered


sample are evaporated to dryness and the solid residue of SiO 2 and OSA is treated with acid and
heat (e.g., 1,200oC) dehydrating the OSA to SiO 2. The solid white water insoluble powder of
impure SiO 2 is weighed and then treated with hydrofluoric acid and heated to volatilize all
silicon. The remaining residue is weighed and the weight subtracted from the weight of the
impure SiO 2 powder in order to calculate the total silica concentration of SiO 2 and OSA that was
in the 50 ml drinking water sample.

### Coradin’s Silicomolybdic Blue Spectrophotometric OSA (Si(OH) 4 ) Assay

Coradin’s blue silicomolybdic spectrophotometric assay is timed to detect only OSA monomer
and dimer and not detect any OSA polymer or silica colloid^29. The assay is based on the ability
of silicic acid and its dimer to quickly form a heteropolyacid, silico- 12 - molybdic acid, in the
presence of acidified heptomolybdate. The silicomolybdic acid has a detection limit of 10-^4 mole
per liter. But when reduced to the molybdenum blue complex, concentrations as low as 5x10-^6
mole per liter can be accurately measured. The reducing agent used is 4-methylaminophenol
sulfate (a.k.a. metol) in the presence of sodium sulfite. Added oxalic acid leads to
phosphomolybdic acid breakdown preventing phosphate interference.

In order to verify accuracy, 1 ml of both 16 and 80 ppm silica water standards traceable to the
U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) are assayed each time a series of
assays are run. A linear plot of absorbance versus OSA concentration at 0 ppm 16 ppm and 80
ppm is used for quantitation of test samples. The silica standard solutions 10 ppm SiO 2 (16 ppm
OSA) in water and 50 ppm of SiO 2 in water (80 ppm OSA) were obtained from the Hach
Company. In 2022, absorbance versus OSA over 80ppm OSA was shown to be nonlinear^174.
Therefore, test samples over 80ppm OSA must be diluted with distilled water to 50-80ppm
OSA immediately prior to testing and results corrected mathematically for dilution.

Solution A is made of 1.0 gram of ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate and 3 ml of concentrated
hydrochloric acid both diluted to 50 ml with distilled water. This solution is stored in a polypro
bottle with polypro cap at 50oF. This solution is not stable indefinitely. However, it has proved
to be good for several months.


Solution B is prepared by adding 20 grams of oxalic acid, 6.67 grams of 4-methylaminophenol
sulfate, 4 grams of anhydrous sodium sulfate, and 500ml of distilled water to a 1 liter volumetric
Florence flask. 100 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid was slowly added and the flask was filled to
1 liter with distilled water. This solution was bottled in two glass bottles with polypro caps.

All samples were acidified to pH 3.3 prior to testing. This is the pH of the gut and is most
closely related to silicic acid bioavailability.

### Stepwise OSA Method

1. 1 ml of an aqueous solution of unknown silicic acid concentration is added to a
    50cc beaker.
2. 15 ml of distilled water is added to the beaker.
3. To this is added 1.5 ml of solution A containing acidic ammonium molybdate
    tetrahydrate.
4. After 10 minutes, 7.5 ml of solution B is added to the assay solution. Solution B
    contains the reducing agent with oxalic acid.
5. The blue color is left to develop over 2 hours at room temperature before
measuring the optical density at 810nm with a spectrophotometer versus both a 1ml
distilled water blank as a “zero” and 1 ml of both NIST traceable 16 and 80ppm standards
subjected to the same procedure as the 1 ml of unknown. The spectrophotometer is
adjusted to read 100 % transmittance with the “zero” prior to measuring each sample.

### Concordance

There is agreement within experimental error of test results from the AWWA total silica analysis
and Coradin’s Blue OSA assay between zero and 100ppm SiO 2 (160ppm OSA).

    aged British men. Lancet; 346:1395-8 (1995) Note: This decade long study of 5661 men 40-
    69 year of age shows that 107 men who had a stroke also had an average 2.8μM/L higher
    level of homocysteine as compared with men who did not have a stroke. These results
    compliment a study that showed a 10% decreased risk of recurrent stroke over a 2 year
    period with an average 3μM/L decrease in homocysteine levels resulting from vitamin
    supplementation^264.

    stroke to prevent recurrent stroke, myocardial infarction, and death; JAMA; 291: 565– 575
    (2004) Note: Based upon the data in this paper a 3μM/L drop in homocysteine due to B12
    (6μg ), B6 (200μg), and folic acid (20μg) daily supplementation resulted in 10% lower risk of
    recurrent stroke and a 16% lower risk of death on average among 1853 patients with non-
    disabling cerebral infarction but higher level (e.g. 100 fold) supplementation was ineffective.
