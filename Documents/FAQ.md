## What is silica-rich water?

Silica-rich water contains at least 48 mg/l orthosilicic acid (OSA). All ground water contains
some silica. The amount of silica in ground water depends on the soil composition, and how
long the water is in contact with the soil. The silica in ground water can be low even though
there are high concentrations of other minerals, like calcium and magnesium. Ground water
with at least 48 mg/l OSA is quite rare.

## How much water should I drink?

You want to drink 3 to 4 cups a day (a liter) of silica water. Spread your drinking throughout the
day. If you do an activity where you sweat, drink some silica water before the activity as
aluminum is excreted in your sweat.

You can drink more than 4 cups per day.

You need a water that has at least 48 ppm of OSA. OSA is the form of silica needed to remove
aluminum from the body. OSA is orthosilicic acid.

## How long will it take to see improvements?

Children with Autism generally see improvement in a few weeks. Improvements are seen but
not limited to language skills, social skills and improved attention and concentration. For adults
with Alzheimer’s improvement is seen in 2 to 4 months.

## How do I convert OSA to silica and silicon content?

OSA has the chemical formula Si(OH)4. OSA has a molecular weight of 96. 48 mg/l OSA
corresponds to 30 mg/l as silica (SiO2, molecular weight 60), and 14 mg/l as silicon (Si,
molecular weight 28). Parts per million (ppm) is the same as milligrams/liter (mg/l).

Here is information on reading the label of bottled water for the (OSA) orthosilicic acid levels.

There are 3 units of measure used to report orthosilicic acid levels on bottled water,

1. to convert silicon (Si) to OSA - multiply by 3.
2. to convert silica SiO2 to OSA multiply by 1.
3. orthosilicic acid or silicic acid Si(OH)4 doesn’t need to be converted. The units can be ppm or
milligrams per liter, these are equivalent units of measure.

## What does silica-rich water do?

Research has shown that OSA helps the body to excrete aluminum. Silica has other beneficial
effects in the body, for example, helping to form strong bones, hair, and nails.

## What is the exact chemistry?

At a pH levels between 5.5 and 8.0, OSA complexes with up to 99 % of aluminum ions. Blood
and part of the kidneys are in this pH range. When OSA is available, it complexes with
aluminum in your kidneys, so that aluminum from your blood leaves your body in your urine.
This can lower your blood aluminum levels by 85 %. Research shows that OSA does not
significantly lower aluminum absorption in rats’ stomachs (which are at a lower pH). If the same
is true in humans, then silica-rich water won’t stop aluminum in your food from getting into
your body. However, the silica-rich water will help the aluminum in your blood to leave your
body in your urine. Why do I need silica-rich water? Silica-rich water can help to protect your
body and brain against the onslaught from aluminum. Modern man is exposed to aluminum
everywhere. The most significant sources are aluminum cookware and pharmaceuticals. There
are many other sources, including aluminum cans, cheap baking powder, some vaccines, large
industrial facilities, anti-perspirants, foot powders based on aluminum salts, and allergy shots.
There are also lots of unexpected sources of aluminum, including coffee machine water heating
tubes, soya, tea, cacao, baby formula, some ground water, water treated with alum, electronic
cigarettes, and even colored candies like M&Ms. If you want to lower the amount of aluminum
in your body, read about the sources of aluminum, and try to reduce or eliminate these.


## Which foods contain silica?

The husks and hulls of grains, and the skins of vegetables contain silica. Green beans, jacket
potatoes, bananas, and beer are good sources of silica. (You shouldn’t cook the jacket potatoes
in aluminum foil, or buy aluminum cans of beer though.)

## Why can’t I just get silica from my food?

There are three reasons why you may not be able to get enough silica from your food. Firstly,
most of the food we eat is refined. The silica-rich husks and hulls are generally removed from
grains, and the silica-rich skins are often removed from vegetables. Secondly, in many areas,
intensive farming has depleted the silica in the soil. Even if your diet is unrefined, your food
might not contain as much silica as it did before intensive farming. Thirdly, we have so much
aluminum exposure that we are unlikely to get enough silica from food.

## Can I mix silica-rich water with a juice concentrate?

You can mix silica-rich water with juice concentrate. The OSA in the silica-rich water is not
affected. If your child doesn’t like water you can add the silica water to their favorite drinks.

## Should I cook with silica-rich water?

It’s not necessary or harmful to cook with silica-rich water, but it will be expensive! Boiling for
more than a few minutes will cause the OSA to precipitate out of solution, rendering it
ineffective to remove aluminum from the body.

## Why not use a silica supplement?

There is no silica supplement that has enough OSA to remove aluminum. Biosil has a low
bioavailability of OSA relative to silica-rich water. Research has detected elevated aluminum in
urine for silica-rich water. However, elevated aluminum in urine has not been detected for
Biosil. Finally, Biosil contains choline, which has been implicated in prostate cancer. Table of
next page.


Dennis Crouse who is a chemist has tested many silica supplements. Some don’t have enough OSA and
others do not have silica in the form of OSA. Here are the testing results.

## What is the half-life for OSA in the body?

When you eat or drink OSA, the OSA exits the body over the next 8 hours. The half-life of
absorbed OSA in the blood is approximately 3 hours. If you want to maximize aluminum
elimination, you can therefore drink some silica-rich water every 3 to 4 hours.

## If silica-rich water is so great, why doesn’t my doctor recommend it?

Doing medical research and spreading knowledge takes time and incentives. Medical traditions
and training can work against innovation. Studies have shown that silica-rich water increases
the excretion of aluminum. Alzheimer’s patients have shown improvement when drinking silica-
rich water. Despite this, silica-rich water has not been accepted as a treatment for Alzheimer’s.
You can wait 10 to 50 years for practice to catch up with research, or you can start drinking
silica-rich water and see for yourself.

## Where can I get silica-rich water?

Some bottled water is silica-rich, that is, it contains more than 48 ppm OSA. For almost 100 brands from
around the world, see the “Bottled mineral waters.pdf” in the files. These include Fiji water from Fiji and
Volvic from France (they contain 1 46 ppm OSA and 51 ppm respectively). Alternatively, you can use tap water to make “Silicade”, with 1 46 ppm OSA. You can find the recipe here: [http://prevent-alzheimers-](http://prevent-alzheimers-)

here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po8IuIXjCME Silicade was developed by Dennis N. Crouse, a
PhD chemist. Silicade has been tested for stability and impurities. Silicade is cheaper and more
environmentally friendly than bottled water. People who drink Silicade have written positive reports.
